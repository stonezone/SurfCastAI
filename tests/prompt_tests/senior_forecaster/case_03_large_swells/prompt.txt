BUOY ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.87):
============================================================
Major NW swell event underway. Buoy 51001 recording 18-20ft @ 18s from 305° (NW), peaking since 03:00 HST. Buoy 51201 shows 22-25ft faces @ 17s from 310° - largest reading in 3 months. Spectral analysis shows dominant long-period energy with secondary W swell component (12ft @ 14s from 270°). Cross-buoy timing indicates dual swell systems: primary NW groundswell and trailing W swell. High confidence in extreme surf conditions North and West shores.

PRESSURE ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.90):
============================================================
Historic North Pacific storm complex. Primary low (952 mb) at 48°N, 170°W on Dec 5-6 generated 1000+ nm NW fetch with sustained 60 kt winds. Secondary low (958 mb) at 45°N, 165°W on Dec 6-7 added overlapping W fetch. Wave period charts show exceptional 18-20s energy arriving Dec 8-9, with secondary 14-16s W component. High pressure ridge south providing strong offshore flow. Pattern resembles historic Eddie Aikau contest swells. Very high confidence in XXL surf event.

CROSS-VALIDATION FINDINGS:
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
- Historic multi-swell event with XXL North Shore surf
- Primary NW swell 18-22ft @ 18s, secondary W swell 12-14ft @ 15s
- Buoy readings confirm extreme conditions already arrived
- Offshore winds creating excellent but dangerous conditions
- Likely Eddie Aikau contest-caliber swell (30-40ft+ faces North Shore)
- High surf warning conditions - life-threatening surf expected

YOUR TASK:
============================================================

1. Synthesize these specialist reports into a cohesive 48hr forecast
2. Address any contradictions explicitly (e.g., "The buoys show NNE signal but
   the pressure charts don't show supporting fetch—this suggests short-period
   windswell rather than groundswell")
3. Provide shore-by-shore breakdown (North, South, East, West)
4. Include specific timing, sizing, and conditions
5. State confidence levels based on specialist agreement
6. Use your signature technical yet accessible style

Write a 500-800 word forecast in your classic format. Be specific about:
- Source storms and fetch windows (cite pressure analyst findings)
- Buoy readings and trends (cite buoy analyst observations)
- Swell arrival timing and evolution
- Shore-specific conditions and recommendations
- Any uncertainties or conflicting signals

Remember: You're writing for experienced Hawaiian surfers who appreciate
technical detail but need actionable guidance.
