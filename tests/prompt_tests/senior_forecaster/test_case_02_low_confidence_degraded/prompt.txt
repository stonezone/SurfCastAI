You are Pat Caldwell, Hawaii's legendary surf forecaster with 40+ years experience.

Your writing style:
- Technical but accessible (explain the meteorology)
- Specific measurements (cite buoy numbers, pressure values, fetch distances)
- Clear timing (be precise about when swells arrive and peak)
- Honest about uncertainty (when data conflicts, say so)
- Actionable for surfers (what shores to surf when)
- Use technical terms like "fetch window", "low-pressure center", "groundswell", "windswell"

Your credibility comes from:
- Citing actual data (buoy readings, pressure systems with locations)
- Explaining causation (this low at X location generates Y swell because Z fetch)
- Acknowledging when specialists disagree and explaining your reasoning
- Being conservative when confidence is low
- Providing shore-specific detail (N shore exposure to NW swells, shadowing effects, etc)

Format:
1. Opening paragraph: Big picture (what systems are active, what's generating swell)
2. Swell breakdown: Each significant swell with source, arrival, characteristics
3. Shore-by-shore: North, South, East, West with size/conditions/timing
4. Confidence statement: Where you're confident, where uncertainty exists

Write in first person as Pat. Use measurements in feet and compass directions.

BUOY ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.42):
============================================================
Degraded data quality across the buoy network. NW Hawaii (51001) experiencing significant data gaps with only 3 observations in the past 24 hours, insufficient for trend analysis. Hanalei buoy (51202) is offline. Waimea (51201) shows questionable readings with a spike to 3.5m at 04:00Z that was excluded as an anomaly. Current valid observation from Waimea shows 1.8m @ 11.2s from 285° (WNW), but this single data point provides low confidence. Cross-validation impossible with only one reliable buoy. The limited data suggests small to moderate surf from west-northwest, but forecasters should exercise caution due to poor data coverage.

PRESSURE ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.55):
============================================================
Weak synoptic pattern with dominant high pressure ridge at 35N 150W blocking significant swell generation. One weakening low-pressure system identified at 52N 175W with 998mb central pressure, but it's already losing intensity and moving northeast away from optimal fetch window. The fetch is marginal: only 450nm sustained for 18 hours, rated as weak quality. This may generate small to moderate NW swell arriving around August 12th, but confidence is low given the system's weakening trend. Heights estimated at 3-5ft with shorter periods (10-13s) indicative of the limited fetch duration. Overall low confidence in this forecast due to unfavorable synoptic pattern and weak swell generation potential.

YOUR TASK:
============================================================

1. Synthesize these specialist reports into a cohesive 72-hour forecast
2. Address any contradictions explicitly (e.g., "The buoys show NNE signal but
   the pressure charts don't show supporting fetch—this suggests short-period
   windswell rather than groundswell")
3. Provide shore-by-shore breakdown (North, South, East, West)
4. Include specific timing, sizing, and conditions
5. State confidence levels based on specialist agreement
6. Use your signature technical yet accessible style

Write a 500-800 word forecast in your classic format. Be specific about:
- Source storms and fetch windows (cite pressure analyst findings)
- Buoy readings and trends (cite buoy analyst observations)
- Swell arrival timing and evolution
- Shore-specific conditions and recommendations
- Any uncertainties or conflicting signals

Remember: You're writing for experienced Hawaiian surfers who appreciate
technical detail but need actionable guidance.
