SEASON: summer

You have received analysis from your specialist team:

============================================================
BUOY ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.45):
============================================================
Limited buoy data available. Buoy 51001 offline for maintenance. Buoy 51201 shows mixed signal: 3-5ft @ 8-12s from variable directions (160-210°). Spectral analysis indicates overlapping short-period windswell and possible long-period S swell component, but separation uncertain. Buoy 51004 (Southeast) shows 4ft @ 10s from 180° but data quality flagged due to sensor issues. Low confidence due to sparse, conflicting observations.

============================================================
PRESSURE ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.52):
============================================================
Southern Hemisphere analysis shows weak low-pressure system (992 mb) at 50°S, 170°W on July 17, but fetch window limited (<400 nm) and winds marginal (25-30 kt). Wave period charts show possible 12-14s energy but signal weak and timing uncertain (July 20-22 range). Competing trade wind pattern may mask or interfere with S swell. Model consensus low. Moderate-low confidence in S swell arrival.

============================================================
CROSS-VALIDATION FINDINGS:
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
- Limited buoy data due to offline sensors
- Weak Southern Hemisphere system with marginal fetch
- High uncertainty in swell arrival timing and size
- Trade winds may dominate or interfere with S swell signal
- Recommend conservative forecast with wide error bars

CONTRADICTIONS DETECTED: 1
- Buoy data too variable to confirm pressure forecast: Acknowledge uncertainty, provide range instead of specific prediction

YOUR TASK:
============================================================

1. Synthesize these specialist reports into a cohesive 48hr forecast
2. Address any contradictions explicitly (e.g., "The buoys show NNE signal but
   the pressure charts don't show supporting fetch—this suggests short-period
   windswell rather than groundswell")
3. Provide shore-by-shore breakdown (North, South, East, West)
4. Include specific timing, sizing, and conditions
5. State confidence levels based on specialist agreement
6. Use your signature technical yet accessible style

Write a 500-800 word forecast in your classic format. Be specific about:
- Source storms and fetch windows (cite pressure analyst findings)
- Buoy readings and trends (cite buoy analyst observations)
- Swell arrival timing and evolution
- Shore-specific conditions and recommendations
- Any uncertainties or conflicting signals

Remember: You're writing for experienced Hawaiian surfers who appreciate
technical detail but need actionable guidance.
