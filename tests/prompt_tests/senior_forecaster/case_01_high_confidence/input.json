Wave heights increased from 8ft @ 14s to 12ft @ 16s over 6 hours, indicating a well-organized groundswell. Direction steady at 315° (NW). Buoy 51201 (North Shore) confirms with 10ft @ 15s from 320°. Spectral analysis shows clean single-peak energy, no overlapping systems. Cross-buoy timing suggests swell propagating at expected group velocity (~30 kt). High confidence in NW swell arrival and size.",
