============================================================
BUOY ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.92):
============================================================
Buoy 51001 (NW Hawaii) shows strong NW swell signal building since 06:00 HST. Wave heights increased from 8ft @ 14s to 12ft @ 16s over 6 hours, indicating a well-organized groundswell. Direction steady at 315° (NW). Buoy 51201 (North Shore) confirms with 10ft @ 15s from 320°. Spectral analysis shows clean single-peak energy, no overlapping systems. Cross-buoy timing suggests swell propagating at expected group velocity (~30 kt). High confidence in NW swell arrival and size.

============================================================
PRESSURE ANALYST REPORT (Confidence: 0.88):
============================================================
Surface analysis shows deep low-pressure center (968 mb) at 45°N, 165°W on Oct 12, generating NW fetch of 800+ nautical miles. Sustained winds 40-50 kt in fetch window for 24+ hours. Wave period forecast charts show 14-16s energy arriving North Shore on Oct 15-16. No competing systems. High pressure ridge to south will provide favorable offshore winds for North Shore. Pattern matches historical NW swell events with high confidence.

CROSS-VALIDATION FINDINGS:
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
- Strong agreement between buoy observations and pressure forecast
- NW swell building as predicted from Oct 12 storm system
- Peak arrival expected Oct 15 afternoon through Oct 16
- Favorable offshore winds from high pressure ridge
- No competing swell systems - clean NW dominant

YOUR TASK:
============================================================

1. Synthesize these specialist reports into a cohesive 48hr forecast
2. Address any contradictions explicitly (e.g., "The buoys show NNE signal but
   the pressure charts don't show supporting fetch—this suggests short-period
   windswell rather than groundswell")
3. Provide shore-by-shore breakdown (North, South, East, West)
4. Include specific timing, sizing, and conditions
5. State confidence levels based on specialist agreement
6. Use your signature technical yet accessible style

Write a 500-800 word forecast in your classic format. Be specific about:
- Source storms and fetch windows (cite pressure analyst findings)
- Buoy readings and trends (cite buoy analyst observations)
- Swell arrival timing and evolution
- Shore-specific conditions and recommendations
- Any uncertainties or conflicting signals

Remember: You're writing for experienced Hawaiian surfers who appreciate
technical detail but need actionable guidance.
