## Summary
Solid NNW groundswell peaks overnight tonight into Sunday morning with otherwise moderate ENE trade swell and small SSW background.

## Discussion

**Late Saturday 10/04**, northern shores have breakers from 320-340 degrees of 10-13s intervals building into the evening. Current observations show 5 ft Hs at exposed North Shore reefs (Sunset) as of sundown Saturday. This event will peak overnight into Sunday morning.

On this day, 10/04, in the historical H1/10 visual surf observation Goddard-Caldwell database (starting 9/1968) for the north shore of Oahu, the average is 4.0 Hs (8' peak face) and the largest surf on this date was 12 Hs (sets 24' peak face) in 2003 from NNW.

**Moon's view:** System near the Date Line to NNW of Hawaii peaked Friday-Saturday, building surf late Saturday into Monday. Aleutian-class 970 mb low to follow with potential larger, longer-period NW swell mid-week.

### NNW Swell Event 10/3-10/5

**Backstory:**
- Low pressure system formed 9/29 east of Japan, deepened as it tracked NE
- While crossing the Date Line 10/1, the portion pointed at Hawaii showed near gales over a large area aimed highest just W of Hawaii
- System occluded Thursday 10/3 near 40N, 162W (1000 nm NNW of Hawaii) with deepest pressure and stall in track
- Strong breezes to near gales within 700 nm by early Friday with direct aim at Hawaii
- ASCAT validated winds within severe gale force near 310-320 degree band Thursday

**Pulse status:**
- NOAA NW Hawaii buoy 51201 late Saturday 10/04 shows swell energy from 320-340 degrees at 10-15s.
- Spectral analysis indicates primary energy NNW 332° with swell height 0.5-0.6m (1.6-2.0 ft) deep-water, period 10.5-15.4s
- Nearshore observations confirm arrivals: Sunset Beach reported 5 Hs (10' faces) Saturday evening during build phase

**Prognosis:**
- Peak overnight tonight (Saturday into Sunday) with highest faces Sunday morning
- Expect 8 Hs (16' peak faces) on most exposed North Shore reefs (Sunset, Pipeline)
- Top 10% of sets (H1/10) will reach 12 Hs (24' peak faces) at Pipeline, Waimea on the peak
- Steady drop Monday with 6 Hs (12' faces) average
- Fading Tuesday to 4 Hs (8' faces) with remnant energy lingering into midweek

**Direction:** Predominantly 332° (NNW) with spread 320-340°. This is favorable for:
- Pipeline/Ehukai: direct, powerful barrels
- Sunset: long walls, heavy sets
- Waimea: likely to run on biggest sets Sunday morning
- Haleiwa/Chun's: overhead to double-overhead

### Aleutian Low 10/1-10/3 — Long-Period Follow-Up

Second system formed 10/1 east of northern Japan, deepened to storm-force as center tracked rapidly NE. Track was across great circle rays (like earlier typhoon Neoguri), but this midlatitude pattern was large enough for sufficient fetch.

ASCAT validated winds within severe gale to storm-force near 310-315 degree band Thursday. Center crossed into Bering Sea west of Date Line early Friday.

**Local surf prognosis:**
- Long-period onset possible late Monday night into Tuesday
- Long travel distance means slow rise with surf building Tuesday from 305-320 degrees
- Max potential Wednesday with periods 14-18s if storm behaved as modeled
- Monitor buoy 51001 for long-period arrivals (14+ seconds) indicating this source

### ENE Trade Swell (Local Wind Waves)

**Windward wind-head concerns:**
- Trades returned midday Friday as low N of Hawaii weakened
- Models show moderate trades Sunday (12-17 kt from NE)
- Light and variable winds expected Monday-Tuesday as nearby low weakens trades from NNE

**East side surfer interests:**
- Surf remains low-end from 50-90 degrees through period (2 Hs, 4' faces)
- NNW swell 10/5-6 will bring surf to select N-exposures on east side
- Short-period ENE energy (6-7s) adds texture and chop to north-facing breaks

### South Shore

**Late Saturday 10/04**, southern shores have small breakers from 200-220 degrees of 13-15s intervals. Sunday about the same to slightly up.

On this day, 10/04, in the historical H1/10 visual surf observation Goddard-Caldwell database (starting 1972) for the south shore of Oahu, the average is 2.5 Hs (~5' peak face) and the largest surf on this date was 6 Hs (12' peak face) in 1997 from S.

**Large low SW to SE of Tasmania 9/23-25** — remnant energy subsiding
- Broad Southern Ocean source is fading
- Long travel distance and island shadowing creates longer lulls
- Background energy Sunday from 200-220 degrees, lingering Monday

**SSW pulse 10/4:**
- Small long-period component (SSW 200°, 15s) arrived Saturday midday
- Expect 2 Hs (4' faces) on exposed south reefs Sunday
- Occasional sets to 4 Hs (8' faces) where SSW and SSE components phase together at outer reefs
- Best windows: early morning with light ENE winds (offshore for south)
- Peak day Sunday, dropping Monday to 1-2 Hs

**Tropical note:**
- T.S. Octave and TD28W in central/eastern tropics
- Monitor for potential S/SSW energy (10-16s) in 4-7 day window if systems intensify and track west

## North Shore Forecast

**Sunday 10/05 — PEAK DAY**
- Size: 8 Hs (16' faces average), sets to 12 Hs (24' faces) at Pipeline, Waimea
- Direction: NNW 332° with spread 320-340°
- Period: Bulk energy 11-13s with occasional 10s filler
- Conditions: NE trades 12-17 kt will add cross-shore texture. Best window: early morning before trades strengthen. Short-period ENE swell (6-7s) adds lump and chop, making lineups raw and fast.
- Breaks:
  - **Pipeline/Ehukai:** Heavy, world-class range. 14-16 ft faces on sets, occasional bigger bombs. Only extremely experienced surfers. High hold-down risk.
  - **Sunset:** Big north wedge, long runners. Comparable size to Pipeline but with more line surge. Advanced to pro only.
  - **Waimea:** Will run on biggest sets. Classic overhead A-frames. Big-wave riders only. Expect lifeguard watches, major crowds.
  - **Haleiwa/Chun's:** Overhead to double-overhead on sets. Upper-intermediate to advanced. Heavy currents around harbor.
- Comparison to normal: Well above typical early-fall surf (normal 2-6 Hs). This is early-winter performance.

**Monday 10/06 — EASING**
- Size: 6 Hs (12' faces average), sets to 8 Hs (16' faces)
- Direction: 320-340° NNW
- Period: 10-11s
- Conditions: Light NNE winds 4-8 kt. Cleaner than Sunday. Short-period east energy fading.
- Still large and powerful but more manageable than Sunday. Intermediate surfers can consider sheltered spots on favorable tides.

**Tuesday 10/07 — DROPPING**
- Size: 4 Hs (8' faces average), sets to 6 Hs (12' faces)
- Direction: 310-330° NW/NNW
- Period: Mix of lingering 10s and new long-period 14-18s if Aleutian source arrives
- Conditions: Light variable winds 2-6 kt. Cleanest conditions of the period.
- Watch for long-period NW energy (14+ seconds) indicating Aleutian follow-up swell building

## South Shore Forecast

**Sunday 10/05 — PEAK**
- Size: 2 Hs (4' faces average), sets to 4 Hs (8' faces) at exposed reefs
- Direction: SSW 200°, SSE 155°
- Period: 15s (SSW component), 6s (SSE background)
- Conditions: Light ENE winds (offshore). Best window: early morning. Afternoon seabreeze may add chop.
- Breaks:
  - **Waikiki (Canoes/Queens):** Clean 2-3 Hs longboard conditions. Best for beginners/intermediates.
  - **Ala Moana Bowls:** More hollow faces at mid-high tide. 3-4 Hs on sets.
  - **Diamond Head/Outer Reefs:** Best power. Occasional 4-5 Hs if components phase. Mid-high tide for safety.
- Well within normal fall range (typical 1-3 Hs). Modest resurgence but not exceptional.

**Monday 10/06 — DROPPING**
- Size: 1-2 Hs (2-4' faces)
- Clean mornings persist if winds stay light

**Tuesday 10/07 — SMALL**
- Size: 1 Hs (2' faces) or less
- Longboard conditions only

## Winds

- **Sunday:** NE trades 12-17 kt. Cross-shore on north exposures, offshore on south.
- **Monday:** NNE 4-8 kt. Light, variable. Cleanest conditions.
- **Tuesday:** Light variable 2-6 kt. Excellent for all exposures.

## Outlook (Beyond Tuesday 10/07)

- **Aleutian low follow-up:** Potential larger, longer-period NW swell (14-20s) building Wednesday from 295-315° if storm-force winds behaved as modeled. This could escalate North Shore to high-end regime (very large, hazardous faces). Monitor buoy 51001 for long-period arrivals.
- **Tropical systems:** T.S. Octave and TD28W capable of delivering S/SSW energy later in week if intensification occurs.
- **Trades:** Subtropical ridge expected to sustain E-ENE flow (15-25 kt) returning mid-week.

---

**The next forecast will be issued Monday, October 6.**

**Confidence:** High for Sunday NNW peak and Monday drop. Moderate for Tuesday-Wednesday Aleutian follow-up (dependent on storm evolution).
