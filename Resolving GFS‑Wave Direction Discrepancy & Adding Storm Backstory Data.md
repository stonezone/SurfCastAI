# Resolving GFS‑Wave Direction Discrepancy & Adding Storm Backstory Data

## 1 GFS‑Wave direction convention

The GFS‑Wave bullet files are generated by the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model coupled to the GFS atmospheric model.  The WW3 manual specifies that the **mean wave direction (`DIR`) is reported in degrees true using the meteorological convention**【821253785985211†L5778-L5794】.  In the meteorological convention, 0° means waves coming **from** the north and 90° means waves coming **from** the east.  The WAVEWATCH III hindcast documentation further clarifies that the primary wave direction variable `.dp.` (and the partition directions `.theta`) represent **directions FROM** which the waves arrive (degrees true)【424941362349491†L190-L199】.  Therefore, a direction of `127 °` in the GFS‑Wave station bulletin indicates waves arriving from 127 ° (east‑southeast).  To convert this to the **oceanographic convention** (direction waves **travel TO**), add 180 ° and wrap to 360 °.  For example:

```
oceanographic_direction = (meteorological_direction + 180) % 360

127° (from) → (127 + 180) % 360 = 307° (to),
```
which is WNW and matches Pat Caldwell’s 300 ° WNW swell.  **This confirms that the discrepancy arises from the direction convention, not an error in amplitude or period.**

## 2 Alternative wave model sources for cross‑validation

The following sources can be used to cross‑validate GFS‑Wave forecasts and to access additional wave model data for Hawaii and the North Pacific.

| source_name | url_template | format | variables | coverage | update_frequency | forecast_horizon | authentication | sample_curl | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ECMWF WAM – Copernicus Marine Service (MFWAM)** | After creating a free account on the Copernicus Marine Service, wave forecasts can be accessed via THREDDS; e.g., `https://my.cmems-du.eu/thredds/dodsC/global-reanalysis-wave-001-032-hourly-tideftp/...` | NetCDF‑4 | Significant wave height, mean/peak period, mean/peak direction, partition parameters【649916018802481†L52-L67】【649916018802481†L112-L168】 | Global (80 ° S – 90 ° N) at ~0.083 ° | Twice daily (00 UTC & 12 UTC)【649916018802481†L112-L168】 | 10 days (3‑h resolution) | **Registration required** (free); API key & password used in URL | `curl -u 'username:password' 'https://nrt.cmems-du.eu/thredds/dodsC/...'` | AVAILABLE (Nov 2025) | High‑quality European wave model; good for global validation.
| **FNMOC/Navy WW3** | Public access is limited; the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) publishes **image charts** of WW3 model output (e.g., significant wave height loops) but does not provide free gridded data via THREDDS.  Example: Stormsurf links to FNMOC images (e.g., `www.fnmoc.navy.mil` with `+12hr` etc.)【622649423842797†L40-L63】. | GIF/PNG images | Significant wave height and period (images only) | Global & regional charts | Updated every 12 h | 6 days (images only) | None | Not applicable | **Images only**; no machine‑readable data. | Useful for quick visual comparison but not for programmatic ingestion.
| **Surfline/LOLA model** | Surfline uses a proprietary **LOLA** wave model.  There is **no official public API** for retrieving model data.  Reverse‑engineered endpoints (e.g., `api.surfline.com/v2/forecasts`) exist but require Surfline account tokens and are subject to terms of service. | Proprietary (JSON) | Spot forecasts (surf height, swell details, wind) | Global surf spots | Updated several times daily | 5–7 days | Requires paid Surfline subscription; no sanctioned public access | N/A | **Not recommended** | Suitable only via Surfline’s front‑end; cannot legally scrape.
| **PacIOOS WW3 spectral output** | PacIOOS’s **WW3 Hawaii regional model** provides significant wave height, peak period/direction, and separate wind‑wave/swell variables via THREDDS (`WaveWatch_III_Hawaii_Regional_Wave_Model_best.ncd`).  The current dataset does **not include spectral partition or full spectrum**; only bulk variables are available【659875458466397†L92-L110】.  The older multi‑1 “ibp” files (e.g., `gfswave.tHHz.ibp_tar`) contain partition data but are large tar files requiring manual extraction and are not served via PacIOOS. | NetCDF (bulk variables) | Significant wave height (`Thgt`), peak period (`Tper`), peak direction (`Tdir`), swell (`shgt`, `sper`, `sdir`), wind‑wave (`whgt`, `wper`, `wdir`)【659875458466397†L92-L110】 | Hawaii region (18–23 ° N, 161–154 ° W) | Hourly | 5 days | None | `curl 'https://pae-paha.pacioos.hawaii.edu/thredds/ncss/ww3_hawaii/WaveWatch_III_Hawaii_Regional_Wave_Model_best.ncd?var=Thgt&latitude=21.3&longitude=-157.8&temporal=all'` | WORKING | For detailed spectral partitions, use the global WW3 partition NetCDF (hindcast) or bullet `ibp` files from NOMADS (see Task 3).  PacIOOS does not host a partition dataset.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CDIP historical statistics** | CDIP maintains long‑term wave buoys (e.g., Waimea Bay 10001, Hanalei 10002).  Data (20‑minute spectra) are available via THREDDS at `https://thredds.cdip.ucsd.edu/thredds/dodsC/cdip/archive/{station}/{station}.nc`.

## 5 Additional buoy stations for swell tracking

To anticipate swells before they reach Hawaii, data from buoys along the swell path are valuable.  Two categories are relevant:

**5a North Pacific/Aleutian buoys (NW swell tracking)**

| Buoy ID | Location & purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **46003 – Shumagin Islands (54.3 ° N, 160.5 ° W)** | Located south of the central Aleutians, this buoy often records swell conditions generated by Aleutian storms 3–4 days before waves reach Hawaii.  Access real‑time data via `https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/realtime2/46003.txt` and historical data via `swden`/`swdir` directories. | Provides significant wave height, period and directional spectra. |
| **46006 – Station Papa (40.7 ° N, 137.5 ° W)** | Located 600 nm west of Eureka, California.  It records swell from North Pacific storms roughly 2 days before hitting the U.S. West Coast and 4–5 days before reaching Hawaii. | Data via NDBC; good early indicator of large WNW swells.
| **46001 – Gulf of Alaska (56.3 ° N, 148.0 ° W)** | Another deep‑water buoy near the Aleutians; monitors swell from northwest storms. | Data via NDBC. |
| **51001 – NW Hawaii** | Already used; 22.8 ° N, 160.5 ° W.  Provides early detection of WNW swells ~1 day before they reach Oahu. | Continue using.
| **51002 & 51004** | Located south and southeast of the islands; useful for southern hemisphere swells. | Data via NDBC.
| **International buoys (Japan/Russia)** | JMA and Russian agencies operate buoys in the western Pacific, but data access is limited and often not in English.  Consider using remote sensing (ASCAT) and reanalysis models instead.

**5b Southern Hemisphere tracking**

For ESE or SSE swells, buoys in the South Pacific can provide early warnings:

- **Tahiti (Station 51407)** – south of Tahiti; monitors South Pacific swells heading north.  Data from `https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/realtime2/51407.txt`.
- **Samoa & Fiji region** – There are few open NDBC buoys; rely on `Open-Meteo` or satellite altimetry (e.g., `Copernicus Sentinel‑3` wave height) to monitor far‑field southern swells.

## Conclusion

The apparent GFS‑Wave direction discrepancy is explained by direction conventions: GFS‑Wave uses the **meteorological convention**, so adding 180 ° converts to the **oceanographic convention** used by surfers.  Pat Caldwell’s WNW forecast thus aligns with the model’s 127 ° value once corrected.  For cross‑validation and storm backstory, incorporate alternative models (ECMWF WAM via Copernicus), high‑resolution regional models (PacIOOS), and additional data sources such as GFS surface pressure, ASCAT winds and IBTrACS storm tracks.  Incorporating remote buoys along the North Pacific swell corridor and, when possible, South Pacific buoys will improve early detection of incoming swells.
