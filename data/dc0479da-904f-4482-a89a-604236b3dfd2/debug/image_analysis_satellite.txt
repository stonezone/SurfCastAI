SUMMARY
Two distinct swell sources visible on the satellite: a pair of tropical cyclonic lows well east of the Hawaiian chain producing a long-period E–ESE groundswell for south- and east-facing breaks (arrival window 48–96 hrs), plus a separate mid-latitude/ frontal low north of the islands sending a shorter-period NW pulse to the North Shore (arrival 12–36 hrs). Trades re-establish through the period and will shape quality — morning windows best.

DETAILS
- Tropical complex (primary): Large, tightly wound spiral centered well east of the islands with strong banding. Visible radial bands and dense cold cloud tops indicate significant wind fetch and long-period swell generation. Swell projection: 16–20s period, direction roughly 100°–125° (E–ESE toward Hawaii). Energy already radiating west — first pulses likely in ~48 hours, building to a peak 60–96 hours after imagery timestamp. Expected size (Hawaiian scale): exposed south/east shores 6–12 ft faces at peak (locally larger at exposed headlands/reef points). Strong currents and long-period sets possible during the peak.
- Tropical complex (secondary/adjacent): Smaller, tighter vortex just west of the primary storm. Producing shorter fetch and more ESE component. Swell: 14–16s period, direction ~120°–140° (ESE–SE), arrival slightly after the primary pulses; contributes to longer duration of south-swell window and more energy for east-facing reefs.
- Mid-latitude/front system (north Pacific): Linear/occluded frontal cloud band and a compact spiral north-northwest of Hawaii with classic comma cloud and frontal cloud bands. Source for a NW-groundswell: 12–14s period, direction ~300°–320° (NNW–NW). First energy arriving in 12–36 hours, peaking ~24–48 hours after imagery. Expected size (Hawaiian): 4–8 ft faces at exposed North Shore spots.
- Atmospheric river / moisture plume: A narrow, elongated moisture band projects northeast from the tropics toward the California coast in the imagery; it is aimed at the eastern Pacific/California and not directly at Hawaii. No concentrated AR aimed at the islands in this image — no immediate large-scale rainmaker shown for Hawaii from an AR.
- Visible swell patterns: Faint linear swell trains are visible propagating westward from the tropical complexes — consistent with the long-period energy forecast above. Surface roughness patterns around the frontal low also show northwest radiating wave trains toward Hawaii.

NORTH SHORE
- Primary swell: NW pulse from the mid-latitude front. Expect surf to rise in the next 12–36 hours with a peak 24–48 hours after the image. Forecast: 12–14s NW swell (300°–320°) producing 4–8 ft Hawaiian faces at exposed North Shore breaks. Best windows will be early morning when winds are light and variable.
- Winds: Trades trending E–NE will become established through the day, turning onshore/side-on for many North Shore breaks in the afternoon (poorer quality). Expect lighter AM winds then 10–20 kt easterly trades by afternoon — plan for morning sessions.
- Specific breaks: Pipeline, Sunset and Ehukai will see the peak energy at exposed points; take care with stronger currents and bigger reef sets at narrow passes. Waimea could see increased sets if the NW component strengthens.

SOUTH SHORE
- Primary swell: Long-period E–ESE groundswell from the tropical pair. Arrival begins ~48 hours, building through 60–96 hours. Forecast: 16–20s E–ESE swell (100°–125°) producing 6–12 ft Hawaiian faces on exposed south and east-facing reef points at peak. Secondary ESE component from the adjacent vortex will lengthen the pulse and add energy to more southerly exposures.
- Winds: Persistent E–NE trades will be onshore/side-onshore for south-facing breaks — expect bump and chop through the afternoons. Best early-morning windows before trades strengthen.
- Specific breaks: Diamond Head, Ala Moana, and south-facing reef points (Oahu) will see the greatest increase. Exposed south shores on Maui and Big Island will run similarly large; be prepared for strong shorebreaks and rip currents.
- Hazards: Strong long-period sets, powerful shorebreak, and rip currents. Larger isolated sets likely at exposed points and reef passes — inexperienced surfers should avoid big days.

OUTLOOK
- Short term: NW frontal pulse will wane within 48–72 hours after peak; expect smaller residual NW background swell thereafter. Tropical-generated south/east groundswell will be the dominant energy for several days once it arrives, with peak 60–96 hours out and a gradual decline over 4–6 days as storms move west or weaken.
- Medium term: If the larger tropical cyclone maintains intensity and forward motion, expect a prolonged south–southeast groundswell train extending beyond the initial pulse — potential for additional peaks 4–7 days out as more energy radiates west. Monitor model updates for cyclone track shifts toward a more direct SSE approach (would increase energy and change arrival timing).
- Trades: E–NE trades expected to strengthen into the period, favoring early-morning cleaner conditions with afternoon bump. Any sustained northward shift of the frontal zone could open brief windows of cleaner NW winds for the North Shore.
Confidence: Moderate — cloud structure shows clear generation sources and visible swell trains, but final surf heights and precise arrival times depend on storm evolution and exact track which should be monitored with sequential imagery and buoy reports.

Bottom line: Expect a short-lived NW groundswell for the North Shore first (good AM windows), then a larger, longer-duration E–ESE groundswell for south/east exposures 48–96 hours out with strong long-period sets and surf hazards. Check buoy reports and watches/advisories as the tropical systems evolve.
