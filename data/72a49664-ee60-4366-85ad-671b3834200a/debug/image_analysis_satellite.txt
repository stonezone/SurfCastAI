SUMMARY
Two primary swell makers visible: a strong, well-organized tropical cyclone off the west coast of Mexico and a vigorous extratropical low north of the Hawaiian Islands. Expect a north-northwest ground-swell to arrive first (48–72 hrs) with a follow-up, longer-period easterly swell from the eastern tropical cyclone in ~4–6 days. A weaker long-period south-southwest pulse from a southern-hemisphere frontal complex is also visible on the imagery and will be a factor later in the 5–9 day window. Trade-wind cloud fields are intact across the islands; expect onshore trade winds to affect surf quality between systems.

DETAILS
- Northern extratropical low (frontal/spiral): center ~north of Hawaii with strong banding and a compact fetch. Generates NW energy aimed at the islands. Expected arrival: 48–72 hours. Swell direction ~315° true, dominant periods 12–15 s. Hawaiian scale size: 8–12 ft (exposed reef faces) at peak; raw, wind-affected in afternoons.
- Eastern Pacific hurricane (distinct eye, strong banding off Mexico): large, intense system with strong symmetric convection and outflow. Energy will radiate westward toward Hawaii — travel time longer. Expected arrival: 4–6 days, peak 5–7 days out. Swell direction ~115°–125° (ESE to E), periods long: 16–20 s (prime energy on the longer end). Hawaiian scale size: 6–10 ft on E/SE-exposed reef points and select open-ocean south-facing spots; energy will be focused more to southeastern and eastern-facing shores.
- Central Pacific tropical cluster (between the two systems): weaker, broader banding east of Hawaii — will contribute a shorter-period easterly component sooner (2–4 days). Swell direction ~120°–135°, periods 10–14 s, Hawaiian scale 3–6 ft.
- Southern-hemisphere frontal system (high latitude, strong curvature): well-defined fetch south of 40°S with organized frontal cloud banding. Generated swell will be long-period SSW energy. Expected arrival: 6–9 days. Swell direction ~200°–210° (SSW), periods 14–18 s, Hawaiian scale 5–8 ft on exposed south-facing reef breaks.
- Wind/weather: trade-wind cumulus field across the islands indicates persistent east-northeast trades 10–20 kt. The northern low will bring stronger gradient/north winds as it approaches; expect breezy to strong northerlies on exposed north shores during the NW swell’s peak.

VISIBLE SWELL PATTERNS
The satellite shows faint linear swell trains radiating west/northwest from the northern low and west from the eastern tropical cyclone — coherent wave bands are visible across the central Pacific basin pointing toward the Hawaiian chain. That confirms energy propagation for the NW pulse (arriving soon) and the longer-period east-to-east-southeast energy arriving later.

NORTH SHORE
- Primary: NW ground-swell from the extratropical low. Arrival window 48–72 hrs, peak 60–84 hrs. Direction ~310°–320°. Periods 12–15 s. Expect solid, raw north–northwest faces: exposed reef points (Pipeline / Ehukai type locations) will see Hawaiian-scale faces 8–12 ft at peak, with larger sets possible locally on the most exposed reefs. Conditions trend choppy in the afternoons as north to northwest winds increase; best windows early AM with any brief offshore/easterly component.
- Secondary: minimal contribution from the eastern tropical cyclone (too southerly) — no significant east-to-southeast energy for the true North Shore lineups.

SOUTH SHORE
- Eastern tropical cyclone will be the main player for east/southeast-facing and some south exposures. Arrival 4–6 days, peak 5–7 days. Direction ~115°–125°, long periods 16–20 s — clean, powerful sets on exposed SE reef points and Hilo/East Maui type breaks. Hawaiian-scale faces 6–10 ft on exposed points; sheltered south coves will see smaller but rideable 3–6 ft.
- Southern-hemisphere swell (from the high-latitude frontal fetch) will arrive later (6–9 days) as a more southerly component (~200°–210°, 14–18 s). That will enhance the regular south-swell pulse at mid-to-late week with 5–8 ft faces on open south-facing reef breaks.
- Trades (E-NE 10–20 kt) during this period will put onshore texture on many south exposures; early-morning windows less textured.

OUTLOOK
- Next 2–3 days: focus on the NW ground-swell from the northern low. Expect peak surf on north-facing exposures within 48–72 hrs, with conditions deteriorating in the wake as winds back to strong northerly.
- Day 4–7: the eastern Pacific hurricane becomes the dominant swell source — long-period E/SE energy will arrive and produce significant surf on east and southeast exposures. Monitor for peak energy days 5–7; this could produce solid sets at exposed reefs and strong currents on streamlines.
- Day 6–9: southern-hemisphere frontal energy will add a SSW component, reinforcing south-facing breaks and possibly combining with the tropical ESE swell for larger, longer-period surf on select exposures.
- Winds: persistent trades will favor morning sessions; the northern low and the tropical systems’ outer wind fields may periodically increase onshore or variable winds and create choppy conditions. Keep an eye on evolving storm tracks — slight shifts in the tropical cyclone track will change arrival timing and arrival angle at the islands.

Bottom line: Expect a strong, wind-affected NW swell first (48–72 hrs) followed by a longer-period ESE tropical swell (4–6 days) with a later southern component. Early-morning sessions will offer the cleanest windows; afternoons likely bumpier under trades and storm-driven winds.
