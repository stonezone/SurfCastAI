SUMMARY
Two distinct swell sources are evident: a strong tropical cyclone complex well off the Mexico/ Baja coast producing long-period E/ENE energy aimed westward, and a mid-latitude frontal/low complex north of the islands producing N to NNW energy. A separate compact storm in the far South Pacific is also visible and will be a delayed source of SSW groundswell. Trades are present around the islands (patchy trade-cumulus field) so expect easterly surface flow through the period until the frontal system approaches.

DETAILS
- East Pacific tropical cyclone (near mainland Mexico/Baja): very well-organized, symmetric cloud shield with a small clear eye and tight banding — classic intense tropical cyclone signature. The storm is east/southeast of Hawaii and radiating long-period swell westward. Expect swell direction into Hawai‘i roughly 090°–115° (E–ESE to EENE) with dominant periods 14–18s. Travel time to Hawaii = roughly 3–6 days depending on distance and storm motion; primary energy arrival: days 3–5 after the satellite time with peak energy concentrated over a 24–48 hour window. Potential Hawaiian-scale size: locally significant on east-facing breaks (forecast range: 4–8 ft Hawaiian scale depending on storm strength and evolution).
- Smaller tropical swirl west of the main cyclone: weaker eye/center and broader banding. Produces additional E/ENE energy (14–16s) that will merge with the primary pulse, prolonging east-swell run-up by 1–2 days on the back side of the main pulse.
- North Pacific frontal/low band (north of Hawaii): long, linear cloud band with embedded vorticity. This is a mid-latitude fetch capable of producing N to NNW swell. Expect swell direction ~320°–340° (NW to NNW) with periods 10–14s. Shorter travel time to Hawaii — arrival window ~2–4 days after the satellite time with peak in a 12–36 hr window. Hawaiian-scale size: likely modest-to-fun on exposed North Shore breaks (2–6 ft Hawaiian scale) depending on fetch strength.
- Southern Hemisphere storm (high-latitude swirl in the lower half of the globe): compact but intense-looking swirl with a focused fetch; cloud banding and curved frontal cloud indicate energy aimed northeast. This will produce SSW–S swell with long periods 16–20s. Travel time to Hawaii is longer — expect arrival in ~6–10 days, with potential for well-organized groundswell on exposed south-to-southwest facing breaks when it arrives. Hawaiian-scale size: small-to-moderate initially, but can produce solid sets on exposed reefs if storm deepens.

NORTH SHORE
- Primary swell for the North Shore will be from the mid-latitude frontal band to the north (NNW, 320°–340°), arriving sooner (2–4 days). Expect the best surf on exposed North Shore points and reefs during the frontal swell peak — cleaner shape where trades are light or veer offshore, but wind timing will be critical.
- If trades remain steady E–ENE through the period, expect onshore/easterly cross chop at some north-facing breaks in the afternoon; mornings should be cleaner. Peak north-northwest energy could produce 2–6 ft Hawaiian scale faces at exposed locations (Waimea, Sunset, Ehukai-type exposures will see the larger end).
- Watch for short-period junk from local frontal bands mixing with the long swell — shorebreak and strong currents possible at exposed reef passes.

SOUTH SHORE
- The immediate image shows minimal locally-sourced south swell; the southern storm is the primary future source. Expect a delayed SSW groundswell in ~6–10 days with long periods (16–20s) that will favor south-to-southwest facing breaks (Ala Moana, Makaha south points, south Maui). When it arrives the swell will be relatively clean early if trades ease, but the prevailing east trades seen in the imagery will likely keep surf a bit textured on exposed south shores until trades back off or rotate.
- East/ENE swell energy from the East Pacific cyclone will also wrap into southeast-facing breaks (east Molokai, east Maui, east Oʻahu) earlier — arrival 3–5 days — producing larger, more consistent sets on those exposures than on the South Shore.

OUTLOOK
- Short-term (next 48–72 hrs): trades dominate; expect small to modest trade-chop with clean windows in the mornings. Frontal energy north of Hawaii will start to push swell toward the islands in ~2–4 days — that will build the North Shore.
- Mid-term (3–7 days): primary impact comes from the East Pacific tropical cyclone(s). Long-period E/ENE swell arrival around day 3–5 with potential to elevate east-facing breaks significantly for a 48–72 hour window. A secondary pulse from the weaker tropical swirl will prolong the run.
- Longer-term (6–10+ days): southern hemisphere groundswell possible from the far-Southern storm; monitor for a strong long-period SSW pulse ~6–10 days out. Also watch the north Pacific frontal zone — if it deepens or retrogrades it could enhance or extend NNW energy to the North Shore.
- Hazards/notes: strong radial swell from the tropical cyclone(s) will increase current risk and rip potential on exposed east and southeast shorelines. If the tropical cyclone intensifies further, expect larger-than-projected E/ENE energy and extended run-up. Local wind trends (easterly trades vs frontal wind shift) will control surf quality — keep an eye on morning wind windows and any frontal passage that could shift winds out of the NW or W, which would clean up north and west exposures.

If you want, I can translate these satellite observations into a day-by-day arrival/peak/decline table for specific breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Ala Moana, Makaha, Honolua) based on assumed travel times.
