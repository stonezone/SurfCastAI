SUMMARY
Two primary swell producers in the North/Central Pacific: a developing gale in the central North Pacific (~996 mb) and a deeper Gulf-of‑Alaska low (~982 mb). Both are oriented to send energy toward Hawaii — expect increasing NNW/NW energy late this week with peak energy late Thu–Sat (3–5 day arrival window). A strong subtropical/high center (1038 mb) sits southeast of the islands and will keep steady trades over Hawaii and partially shadow more southerly/long‑range energy (Typhoon Halong and southern TS Octave) — south shore remains mostly quiet.

DETAILS
- Central Pacific developing storm (estimated 38N 170W, 996 mb): moving ENE ~20–25 kt. Fetch on its southern quadrant is oriented toward Hawaii (roughly 300–330° true) with sustained winds likely 30–40 kt in the main fetch. Generates a short/medium-period NNW swell ~12–14 s arriving Hawaii in ~3–4 days. Swell potential: medium‑high for exposed north and NNW‑facing breaks.
- Gulf of Alaska low (estimated 45N 155W, 982 mb): moving E‑NE ~25–30 kt. Broad NW fetch on its southern flank aimed at Hawaii (approx 295–310°). Longer period energy (14–16 s) will arrive slightly after the central Pacific pulse, packing more punch at peak. Swell potential: high for big, longer‑period NW energy with good long‑distance propagation.
- Typhoon Halong (976 mb, far west Pacific): strong but far (west of 140E). Long distance and the large subtropical high (1038 mb) between Halong and Hawaii mean limited direct swell energy to reach the islands — swell potential: low-moderate and heavily attenuated if any.
- Tropical Storm Octave / low near 130W (995–1008 mb): located well southeast/south of Hawaii. Fetch and orientation are not ideal for strong south swell to Hawaiian south shores in the next few days; any southern energy will be small and delayed (5–7+ days).
- Frontal activity: cold fronts and occlusions are present across the NW Pacific and wrapping into the developing/deeper lows noted above. These fronts are the primary generators of the NW/NNW gales producing the forecast swell pulses.
- Pressure gradients: tight gradient between the 1038 mb high (centered roughly 30–32N, 160–165W) and the 996/982 mb lows across 155–175W. Expect strong W‑NW winds 25–40 kt in the fetch corridors — very favorable for swell generation. The large, high‑center also reinforces trades over the Hawaiian Islands (E/ENE 15–20 kt), degrading exposed breaks at times.

NORTH SHORE
- Arrival/timing: First measurable rise late Thursday with the central Pacific 12–14 s NNW pulse; the Gulf‑of‑Alaska 14–16 s NW component peaks late Thu–Sat. Combined peak window Fri (late) into Sat morning for the most exposed north/NW faces.
- Size: Expect exposed North Shore lineups to move into the 8–12 ft Hawaiian scale range at peak (some peak intervals 10–14 ft Hawaiian on the largest sets at Sunset, Ehukai and Pupukea). Pipeline and Sunset will see significant size and power — hold for big-swell protocols.
- Direction/period: Primary directions 300–330° true; energy arriving primarily 12–16 s periods (mix of shorter central Pacific swell and longer Gulf‑of‑Alaska swell).
- Winds/quality: Persistent E–ENE trades 10–20 kt (stronger midday) from the subtropical high produce cross‑onshore conditions for much of the North Shore — best windows early mornings when winds tend lighter. Expect choppy/warbled conditions on exposed points during onshore gusts; some protected spots and deep reefs will clean up briefly on light offshore shifts.

SOUTH SHORE
- Current outlook: Minimal direct southern swell energy in the next 3–5 days. TS Octave and tropical energy are too distant and partially blocked by the large high; any south hemi energy will be small and delayed.
- Size/period: Background south/east waist‑to‑knee surf (1–3 ft Hawaiian scale) at the more protected south beaches (Ala Moana, Waikiki). No significant long‑period south pulse expected in the immediate 3–5 day window.
- Winds/quality: Trades (E–ENE 10–20 kt) will produce bump on east‑facing breaks and light chop on south exposures; best small‑surf windows early mornings when trades back or are lighter.

OUTLOOK
- Fri–Sat: Peak of the combined NNW/NW pulse; largest north‑facing exposures should see the most consistent sets. Conditions probably rough mid‑day on the North Shore from trades; early AM the cleanest.
- Sun–Mon: Gradual decay as fetch weakens and lows move east; swell energy drops through the weekend into early next week. Residual long‑period NW energy may hang around into early next week at smaller size.
- Beyond 7 days: Watch for redevelopment in the NW Pacific/Gulf of Alaska; repeated frontal passages could produce another NW pulse late next week. Tropical systems (Halong/Octave) are present but unlikely to deliver significant clean energy to Hawaii while the subtropical high remains strong and trades persist.
