SUMMARY
Primary threat: two northwest/Gulf-of-Alaska swell sources — a developing storm ~38N/160W and a larger GA low farther north — will send long-period N to NNW energy to the North Shore. Expect building N-NNW swell mid‑week (arrival Oct 9–11), peaking in the 10–15 ft Hawaiian scale range with 14–18 s periods at peak. Trades are reinforced by a strong subtropical high (1038 mb) centered near 30N/165W producing steady NE trades 15–25 kt — wind-affected conditions for exposed east- and south-facing breaks.

DETAILS
- Developing storm (labelled “DVLPG STORM”): center ~38N, 160W, pressure ~996 mb. Fetch oriented NW→SE aimed toward Hawaii (roughly 320–330° true to the islands). Peak winds in the gale quadrant ~35–45 kt over a 300–600 nm fetch. Swell potential: moderate→high for Hawaii. Expected swell: 14–16 s dominant periods, arrival ~72–96 hrs after peak forcing (best energy Oct 9–10). Hawaiian scale faces 8–12 ft building to 10–14 ft at exposed north-facing reefs at peak.

- Gulf of Alaska low system (northern low/“982–993” area): center ~45–50N, ~150W, pressure ~990–994 mb with gale-force winds and a frontal band extending southeast. Fetch orientation NW (310–335°) into the NE Pacific. Producing longer-period energy: 16–18 s periods. Travel time to Hawaii ~4–6 days; expect arrival windows Oct 10–13. Peak size at solid North Shore exposures: 12–16 ft Hawaiian scale faces with heavy lines and strong currents.

- Coastal CA/nearshore low: ~36–38N, ~122W, ~1008 mb — limited local NW fetch; short travel distance gives shorter period, more wind‑chop; negligible contribution to long-period energy for big North Shore peaks.

- Tropical systems: T.S. Octave (~60 kt) located southeast of Hawaii (near 130–140W) and Typhoon Halong far west. Octave is producing SSW–S swell energy (approx. 160–180°) but fetch is compact and partially blocked by the subtropical high/flow pattern. Expect small, short‑to‑medium period tropical swell (8–12 s) arriving later in the week (Oct 10–14) — background S–SSW 2–4 ft Hawaiian scale at best, more detectable at exposed southern points.

- Subtropical high / trades: 1038 mb high centered near 30N/165W. This is a strong, broad high producing a persistent NE trade flow across the islands. It will:
  - Enhance trade wind speeds (most daytimes 15–25 kt, lighter mornings).
  - Create a wind shadow to the southwest of the high (limits some SE/SSW swell energy into Hawaii).
  - Tend to refract/attenuate southern/tropical swell energy trying to wrap into the islands; southern swell from Octave/Halong is therefore reduced.

NORTH SHORE
- Arrival: first measurable N–NNW mixed swell energy late Wed–Thu (Oct 9–10), building through Fri (Oct 10–11).
- Size/period: main swell 14–18 s, faces 10–15 ft Hawaiian scale at exposed points (Pipeline, Ehukai, Haleiwa). Backdoor/NNE components may fill Sunset/Mokuleia with heavier long-period sets.
- Wind: NE trades 10–15 kt mornings, rising to 15–25 kt afternoons. Best windows are early AM when trades lighten; expect increasing texture and onshore cross‑chop through the day.
- Hazards: heavy, powerful waves at exposed reef passes; strong currents and shorebreak at shallow points. Biggest sets at Pipeline and off the Pua‘ena stretch.

SOUTH SHORE
- Background: overall quiet for raw southern hemi energy due to the subtropical high blocking long fetch. Expect only modest tropical/south swell from Octave — short to mid period (8–12 s).
- Size: 2–4 ft Hawaiian scale at most southerly exposures (Ala Moana, Diamond Head, Makapuu still small due to trade winds from NE).
- Wind: NE trades produce east‑to‑onshore flow for many south‑facing breaks, choppy conditions and reduced surf quality through afternoons; better small-wrinkle conditions in morning.
- Best spots: protected south‑facing, wind‑protected coves and reef points will see the most usable small surf (longboard rides).

OUTLOOK
- Fri–Sun (Oct 11–13): NW energy likely peaks then slowly trends down as Gulf-of-Alaska fetch moves east and weakens. North Shore surf remains sizeable but begins to ease late weekend.
- Beyond 7 days: another frontal band is shown developing northwest of the Aleutians on the chart analysis — moderate confidence for additional NW swell late next week (arrival ~Oct 14–17) depending on amplification. Tropical sources (Octave/Halong) remain possible generators of small episodic SSW energy but will be curtailed by the subtropical high unless track/strength change.
- Trades are expected to persist (NE 10–25 kt) for the forecast period, so expect cleaner early mornings and windier, choppier afternoons statewide.

If you want estimated arrival/peak dates converted to calendar days for specific spots (Pipeline / Sunset /Waikiki /Ala Moana) I can list them with direction (deg), period (s), and Hawaiian-scale size by break.
