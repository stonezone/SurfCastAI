SUMMARY
No organized tropical cyclone in the scene. Satellite shows typical trade-wind cumulus around the islands with a weak, elongated cloud band well north of the state — no strong spiral or eye. Actionable surf: persistent short-period NE trade swell (local wind swell) is the dominant energy through the next 24–48 hours; a weak NNW groundswell/energy pulse from that northern cloud band is visible and will add small NW/N-NNW surf to exposed north-facing breaks late next 24–72 hrs.

DETAILS
- Trade-wind (NE) swell: direction ~055°–070° (ENE to NE), period 6–8 s, Hawaiian scale ~2–4 ft. This is the continuous, locally generated trade swell visible as short, messy wind-sea and small, close-spaced swell lines in the nearshore imagery. It will persist today and through the next 48 hours while trades remain in place.
  - Timing: already present this morning (image time ~09:40 HST), holds through today, with the best cleaner windows early mornings and late evenings when winds relax locally.
- Weak NNW groundswell pulse: direction ~320°–335° (NNW), period ~10–12 s, Hawaiian scale ~3–5 ft (small-moderate). The elongated cloud band and subtle banding northwest of the islands indicate a weak, broad fetch/front well to the north; energy is already radiating toward Hawaii and will arrive as a modest groundswell pulse over the next 24–48 hours.
  - Timing: initial increase late tonight into Thursday morning (small pulse), peak energy for exposed North Shore breaks likely late Thursday into Friday, then gradual decline through the weekend.

- No atmospheric river or tropical moisture plume is evident — no concentrated narrow moisture plume aimed at the islands in the visible scene. Expect scattered trade showers, localized heavier showers under convective cloud clusters.

NORTH SHORE
- Conditions: Small-moderate NNW groundswell arriving late tonight/Thursday with period ~10–12 s and direction ~320°–335°. Combined with ongoing NE trade bump, exposed north-facing points (Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa) will see a clear uptick.
  - Expected sizes (Hawaiian scale): 3–5 ft (groundswell component) on top of a 2–3 ft NE trade background → exposed lineups could see 6–10 ft faces at the most exposed reef/pipeline-type spots at peak. Most beachbreaks and protected coves will see chest-to-overhead lines rather than giant surf.
  - Winds: Trade cumulus pattern implies easterly to northeasterly trades ~10–15 kt. Expect cleaner conditions in the early morning; afternoon onshore/quartering trade winds will make many spots bumpier. North shores facing NW will be best in the morning hours.
  - Hazards: Typical strong currents at exposed points with the groundswell pulse; smaller increases in shorebreak at open beaches.

SOUTH SHORE
- Conditions: Little to no long-period southerly energy evident. South-facing beaches will be dominated by the local NE trade bump refracting around islands — small, short-period, messy surf.
  - Expected sizes (Hawaiian scale): 1–2 ft with short, choppy period (6–8 s). Best use for longboarders and beginners at protected spots (Ala Moana/Prince Kuhio, Diamond Head when winds ease).
  - Winds/Weather: Trade showers moving over and through south exposures through the day; early-morning sessions will be cleaner before trades strengthen.

OUTLOOK
- Next 48–72 hrs: The weak NNW groundswell should peak late Thursday into Friday for exposed North Shore spots, then trend down into the weekend as the northern cloud band moves east and energy spreads out. Trades will remain the baseline energy through the period; expect NE winds 10–15 kt most days with typical diurnal variability (lighter mornings).
- No tropical cyclone threat indicated on the current imagery; no atmospheric river signature to bring prolonged heavy rain. Watch for additional small frontal/cloud-band energy moving east across higher latitudes — another small NNW pulse is possible later in the 5–7 day window if that band intensifies or tightens.

Bottom line: Surf today is dominated by short-period NE trade swell — small and punchy on windward shores. A modest NNW groundswell is incoming late tonight through Friday for the exposed North Shore; plan morning sessions for the cleanest conditions.
