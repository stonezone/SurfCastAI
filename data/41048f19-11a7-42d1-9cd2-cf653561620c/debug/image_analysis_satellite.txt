SUMMARY
Two primary swell-makers visible: a strong tropical cyclone off southern Baja with a well-defined eye and tight banding (E–ESE energy toward Hawai‘i), and a smaller but organized mid‑Pacific cyclone between Baja and the islands (E/ENE energy). A separate extratropical low and frontal cloud band well north of Hawai‘i will be the source of shorter‑period NNW energy for the North Shore. Trades are active across the islands (classic trade‑cumulus field). Actionable: expect rising N‑facing surf first (next 24–48 hrs) from the northern low, then a longer‑period E/ENE–ESE tropical swell building for south and southeast exposures later in the period. Smaller S/SSW energy from a broad Southern Hemisphere fetch may arrive later in the outlook.

DETAILS
- Tropical cyclone off Baja (clear eye, strong banding): fetch center ~east‑southeast of Hawai‘i. Producing very long‑period energy (estimated 18–20s) directed WNW–WNW out of the storm’s western semicircle; for Hawai‘i this will manifest as ESE–E energy (bearing ~100°–120°). Travel time for 18–20s swell from this location to Hawai‘i is on the order of 3–5 days — expect the swell to start showing on exposed south/southeast shores ~72 hrs after the satellite time, peak 96–120 hrs, then slowly decline over several days.
- Mid‑Pacific cyclone (smaller, with banding): close enough to send medium long‑period energy (estimated 14–16s) arriving sooner. Direction into Hawai‘i will be E–ENE (bearing ~080°–100°). Arrival ~36–72 hrs, peak ~48–96 hrs, then fade.
- Northern extratropical low / frontal band: linear cloud bands and a broad circulation north of the islands indicate a fetch generating NNW swell (periods ~12–15s). This energy is closer — arrival within 12–36 hrs, peak in the 24–48 hr window, with a faster decay.
- Southern Hemisphere/Antarctic frontal cloud mass at high latitudes (southern quadrant of image) is a broad fetch likely to generate S–SSW energy (periods ~14–16s) that will take ~5–8 days to arrive and produce modest background south swell.
- Winds: trade cumulus field east of the islands indicates active ENE trades. Expect moderate trades (10–20 kt) — favoring cleaner conditions on the south shore (offshore/side‑offshore for many south exposures) and producing side‑onshore to onshore chop on north and west facing breaks. Embedded convective banding near the tropical systems means intermittent squalls and gusts near the storm‑track swell arrival.

NORTH SHORE
- Timeline: NNW swell from the frontal/extratropical low north of Hawai‘i will be the first to lift the North Shore. Expect surf to rise within 12–36 hrs, peak in the 24–48 hr window, then decrease over the following 48 hrs.
- Swell specs: NNW swell 12–15s, arriving from ~300°–320°. Hawaiian scale faces: expect primary exposed North Shore breaks to see 8–12 ft faces near peak at the most exposed locations (Pipeline, Sunset), with larger sets possible at Waimea if local wind/wave alignment and tide cooperate.
- Quality: ENE trades will be cross‑to‑onshore for many north-facing spots — expect choppy conditions at exposed points and cleaner windows only when trades relax (often early morning). Strong currents and rips at reef passes with the rise — caution advised.
- Specifics: Pipeline and Sunset will show consistent large sets during the peak period; Waimea Harbor and other deep‑water sand channels will have strong rip flow. Makaha (west side) may see wrap but will be more affected by wind clutter.

SOUTH SHORE
- Timeline: The dominant south/southeast swell from the Baja tropical cyclone will take longest to arrive. Expect the first pulse to show in 72–96 hrs, building to a peak about 96–120 hrs after the satellite time, with elevated levels 4–7 days after the image.
- Swell specs: E/ENE–ESE long‑period swell 16–20s (primary energy ~110°–100°). Hawaiian scale faces at exposed south and southeast reefs: expect 4–8 ft faces at peak on exposed points (Ala Moana Bowls, Diamond Head, east‑facing reef points) with stronger sets on more exposed SE coves. Local mid‑period energy from the mid‑Pacific cyclone (14–16s) will mix in earlier, giving some elevated south‑southeast surf before the main tropical pulse.
- Quality: Trades from the ENE will generally be favorable for many south exposures (offshore/side‑offshore), so the south shore should see relatively clean surf in early‑morning hours. Once the tropical swell arrives there will be increased currents, strong longshore flow, and potential for squally rain bands to produce wind shifts and gusts — surf quality will vary around squalls.
- Specifics: Waikiki and Ala Moana will pick up longer rides and increased longshore sets; Diamond Head and Koko Head exposures will show bigger, punchier sets. Watch for hazardous shorebreak and rip currents during peak.

OUTLOOK
- Decline: The northern frontal swell should fade within ~3–4 days after peaking. The tropical E/ENE–ESE swell from the Baja cyclone will dominate the mid‑period outlook for 4–7 days, then slowly drop. Expect elevated south/southeast energy to linger longer than the north swell due to the long period and sustained tropical fetch.
- Beyond 7 days: Southern Hemisphere energy from the high‑latitude frontal field visible in the southern quadrant is likely to produce a modest S/SSW background swell 5–8+ days out — watch for a late‑range boost to small south exposures. Satellite also shows continued baroclinic activity north of Hawai‘i; another short‑period NNW pulse is possible later in the week if that frontal band tightens.
- Hazards: Squalls embedded in the tropical cloud bands mean localized heavy rain, gusty variable winds, and sudden wind shifts during the E/ENE swell arrival — expect shifting conditions, strong rip currents, and reduced visibility at times.

Bottom line: Expect a near‑term pickup on the North Shore from a frontal/low system (12–15s NNW swell, peaks next 24–48 hrs) with chop from ENE trades. A longer‑period E/ENE–ESE tropical swell from the Baja region will follow later in the period (16–20s), building south/southeast exposures into the weekend and producing the best clean windows on south‑facing breaks in the early mornings between trade‑gusts. Watch for squalls and strong currents when the tropical swell arrives.
