# Hawaii Surf Forecast
*Generated on October 06, 2025 at 23:40 *

## Main Forecast

### Summary
A composite north-to-northwest pulse is in place for Oahu beginning Oct 6 (HST). Dominant N/NNW energy with **11–12s** periods producing solid north faces; smaller short-period NNE energy and a minor SSE component are present. East‑southeast trades (wind 110°) will keep most north exposures bumpy except for early‑morning windows. South Shore remains mostly small with only a weak southerly component; monitor E‑Pac tropical activity for a later south pulse. Confidence 0.6/1.0.

### Details
- Primary composite north energy: multiple N components arriving ~2025-10-06T19:26–19:56Z (UTC). Combined Hawaiian-scale heights: several contributors — 6.**9 ft** @ 11s (N), 6.**2 ft** @ 12s (N), 5.**6 ft** @ 11s (NNW ~330°), plus 4.9/4.**3 ft** N components. Net result: strong N-to-NNW swell vector centered roughly 340°–330° with dominant periods ~**11–12 s**. Peak energy recorded at the listed arrival times (19:26–19:56Z on 10/06) with highest faces Oct 6 into Oct 7 local.
- Shorter-period NNE bump: NNE energy (**7–8 s**) at ~020° arriving same window (6.**9 ft** @ 8s, 6.**6 ft** @ 7s) — produces more punchy, closeout sets at exposed points and mixes with the longer N energy to create confused sets and hold‑downs.
- Minor SSE component: small SSE swell (1.**6 ft** @ 13s, ~160°) present as background; negligible for most south exposures through Oct 8.
- Wind/Weather: observed wind vector 110° (ESE trade orientation). Although speed not provided, the trade orientation favors east‑side windswell and side‑onshore flow for North Shore exposures — expect onshore-to-side chop outside early-morning lulls. Air temp ~27°C.
- Tides: provided low around 2025-10-06T06:54Z (0.**02 ft**) — be aware of tidal swings affecting peak surf at shallow reef passes during the Oct 6–8 window.

NORTH SHORE (Oct 6–8)
- What to expect: Solid N/NNW swell through Oct 6 into Oct 7. Expect general Hawaiian-scale face ranges:
  - Exposed reef heads (Pipeline/Ehukai, Sunset): **8–12 ft** Hawaiian scale at peak sets on Oct 6–7 when the **11–12s** energy lines up with the reef. Pipeline and Sunset will see powerful, hollow sets — hold‑downs likely.
  - Mid-exposure points (Haleiwa / Chun’s): **6–9 ft** Hawaiian scale faces with long, heavy sets; current and rips will intensify.
  - Larger west-facing reefs (Makaha): long-period sets with strong push, expect **6–10 ft** Hawaiian scale depending on local wrap.
- Timing: arrival/peak per provided timestamps — energy showing up 2025‑10‑06 (UTC times 19:26–19:56). Locally this produces rising surf through Oct 6 and a peak/steady state into Oct 7, then gradual decline by Oct 8 as the initial pulse radiates out.
- Winds & quality: 110° trade/ ESE flow will tend to be cross‑onshore/side‑on at north exposures; best conditions early morning when trades are typically lighter. Expect choppy, blown sets by late morning–afternoon. Protected north-facing coves with lee shelter will offer the cleanest windows.
- Hazards: big, powerful sets with significant shorebreak at shallow reefs; strong alongshore currents and hold‑downs at Pipeline/Sunset — not for inexperienced surfers.

SOUTH SHORE (Oct 6–8)
- What to expect: Small background south energy only. SSE component (1.**6 ft** @ 13s) is present but trivial — most south reefs and beaches will be **1–3 ft** Hawaiian scale with occasional slightly larger pulses at the most exposed southern reef passes.
- Timing: no significant south swell arrives through Oct 8 based on provided components; any noticeable south change would be from a tropical system later in the run (see OUTLOOK).
- Winds & quality: 110° trades produce cross‑offshore to slightly offshore flow for some south-facing points early, but also generate east windswell and surface chop on exposed east bays. Best south-surf windows will be in the morning and at protected reef passes (Diamond Head, Ala Moana) if the SE trade eases.
- Hazards: confused combinations where small southern long‑period lines intersect local short‑period east swell — watch for unpredictable rips.

OUTLOOK (beyond Oct 8)
- Short range (Oct 9–11): Expect the current N/NNW pulse to ebb through Oct 8–9. Pressure/satellite analyses indicate a developing mid‑latitude / E‑Pac cyclone and a separate Aleutian surge that are likely to produce a larger NW/WNW long‑period swell in the 72–120 hr (3–5 day) and 4–7 day windows, respectively. That larger NW pulse would arrive after the Oct 6–8 window and could produce extended significant north faces on exposed North Shore reefs — monitor for **14–16 s** (and possible **15–18 s** later) energy.
- Tropical watch: satellite analysis and synoptic charts show a tropical system (T.S. Octave) in the east Pacific capable of sending a conditional S/SSW pulse in ~4–7 days. If Octave holds intensity/track it may produce a modest south swell (**2–4 ft** Hawaiian scale) for the South Shore later in the outlook period.
- Winds: a strong central Pacific high will likely maintain E–NE trades through the period, keeping east windswell and onshore tendency for north and east exposures; any short clean windows will be early mornings or during transient gradient lulls.
- Bottom line: Oct 6–8 — solid, powerful north-to-northwest surf with punchy short-period NNE components; best for experienced North Shore crews in early-morning windows. Watch for a larger NW pulse and a possible tropical south addition after Oct 8. Overall forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0.

## North Shore Forecast

North Shore surf forecast — Oct 6 → Oct 8, 2025
(Technical / practical — Hawaiian scale heights, swell period & direction analysis, wind impacts, timing and break notes)

### Synopsis
- Multiple north-directed swell trains are in the water. The energy is predominantly from true N (and NNW/NNE components) with periods clustered **7–12s**. That combination gives strong long-period punch at the exposed north-facing reefs, with shorter-period NNE energy adding lump and more punch at shallower, close-proximity pieces.
- Wind reported 110° (ESE). Speed not provided — forecast behavior depends heavily on whether that is light (<10 kt) or moderate/strong (>10–15 kt). See wind scenarios under “Wind & weather”.
- Compared with a normal early‑fall pattern (typical 2–6+ ft Hawaiian from NW–WNW), this is a step up: multiple long‑period N swells in the **6–7 ft** Hawaiian range are pushing the shore. Expect above‑average size and power for early fall—closer to transition/winter energy at the most exposed reefs.

SWELL COMPONENTS (given in Hawaiian scale)
- N: 6.**9 ft** @ 11.0 s — primary long-period energy (strong effect on exposed north reefs)
- N: 6.**2 ft** @ 12.0 s — long‑period reinforcement, very efficient energy for deep-water transfer
- N: 4.**9 ft** @ 11.0 s — additional long‑period filling
- N: 4.**3 ft** @ 12.0 s — background long-period support
- NNW: 5.**6 ft** @ 11.0 s — fills more of the northwest-facing points
- NW: 3.**3 ft** @ 10.0 s — adds westward wrap to Sunset-type exposures
- NNE: 6.**9 ft** @ 8.0 s and NNE: 6.**6 ft** @ 7.0 s — shorter-period, higher-frequency energy that will produce steeper, punchier sections on shallow reefs and shorebreaks; tends to make conditions lumpier and more closeout-prone

### General Effects / How It Looks
- Energy mix: Long-period N energy (**11–12s**) is the driver — efficient at generating big, powerful faces on Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea and other open north-facing reefs. The NNE **7–8s** component will make the lineups more peaky and can produce quick, steep sets on shallower pieces and beaches.
- Expect lots of double-up sets on exposed reefs. Sets will be powerful and push fast — late‑takeoff, steep faces on Pipeline/Sunset; very heavy shore impact at Waimea.
- Shape: On the peak day the surf will be thick, hollow and fast at the prime reefs. Lesser-exposed sandbars and protected coves will see push and current but not the same clean wave faces.

TIMING (Oct 6 → Oct 8)
- Oct 6 (build): Morning into afternoon will show building north energy as the mid-period components (**4–6 ft** Hawaiian) establish. Expect generally solid north exposures in the **3–6 ft** Hawaiian range early, increasing through the day. Shorter-period NNE energy will make the surface a bit lumpier.
- Oct 7 (peak): The long-period N **6–7 ft** Hawaiian components should be fully in play. Peak of the event will be Oct 7 (overnight into day). Exposed reefs and points will see their largest and most consistent sets on this day — expect the most powerful conditions here. If winds stay light early, there will be a clean window; if winds strengthen from ESE, expect texture and pushing onshore (see wind scenarios).
- Oct 8 (dropping): Energy eases as the larger long-period trains phase out; surf remains elevated but becomes more disorganized with the shorter-period trains dominating the smaller pieces. By late Oct 8 expect size and period to trend downward, with fewer very large sets.

WIND & WEATHER — 110° (ESE) — scenarios and practical impacts
- If winds are light (<10 kt): ESE at this angle tends to be near sideshore to slightly offshore for some north‑facing reefs early in the day depending on local orientation — morning should be the cleanest window on most spots. Expect good lines, hollow barrels at Pipeline/Sunset/Waimea on sets, with manageable surface texture.
- If winds are moderate/strong (>10–15 kt): ESE becomes more onshore for many north- and northwest-facing reefs — expect chop, blown-out lips and earlier closeouts. Offshore reef barrels will be harder to find; exposed shorebreaks and beaches will fill and run. Small coastal gaps and west-facing points may see more favorable angles but overall quality drops.
- Additional notes: ESE trades can also push swell energy slightly into the shallow reef zones, steepening takeoffs and aiding wedge formation at some spots (dangerous). Morning low winds are the sweet spot.

BREAK–BY–BREAK (practical size guidance, conditions, who it’s for)
Note: heights given in Hawaiian scale — these are expected working ranges, not guaranteed single-set values. Local wind and tide will modulate final size and shape.

- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai Pipeline)
  - Expected: **6–8 ft** Hawaiian on sets with heavier moments; long-period N (**11–12s**) is perfect for big, hollow Pipeline. NNW component fills the line.
  - Shape: Very fast, hollow, world‑class barrels on the prime reefs. Sets will be thick and push hard; late‑drop, heavy sections and fast barrels that reform inside.
  - Who: Only expert/marine veteran big‑wave surfers. Dangerous hold‑downs and metal‑to‑reef situations. If winds are light early you’ll see the best barrels; with ESE breeze it will still be surfable but bumpier.
  - Hazards: Strong currents in the channel, backwash, crowded lineup with high-consequence waves.

- Sunset Beach
  - Expected: 6–8+ ft Hawaiian on sets (northwest wrap helps this spot), with some very large sets on the peak day.
  - Shape: Long, powerful walls and fast closeouts. The NW component (**3–5 ft** Hawaiian) will help wrap energy into the Sunset reef, making the sets long and punchy.
  - Who: Advanced to expert — long, fast takeoffs and heavy runouts. Lots of shorebreak and dumping on the inside.
  - Hazards: Long high-speed rides, shallow reef/pump sections, strong rips.

- Waimea Bay
  - Expected: Very active — with the **11–12s** N energy in the **6–7 ft** Hawaiian range, Waimea will be solid to very large. Expect extremely powerful shorebreak and big, heavy walls.
  - Shape: Short, steep faces and massive shore impact. This is the kind of swell that will run Tow/No-Tow depending on exact size; if the N 12s component holds, Waimea runs heavy and dangerous.
  - Who: Expert big-wave riders only. If you don’t have ocean‑rescue backup or a tow team (for the truly giant days), do not attempt.
  - Hazards: Massive impact zone, shifting sand, hold‑downs, and extreme currents.

- Haleiwa / Rocky Point / Pua’ena / Chun’s (general North Shore reefs and points)
  - Expected: **4–7 ft** Hawaiian on sets depending on exact orientation; NNE short-period energy will make some of the shallower reefs punchier and more closeout-prone.
  - Shape: More sectional at points than reef; lots of doubles and fast sections. Smaller inside sandbars will be jumpy.
  - Who: Advanced-intermediate at the lower end; many days will be more suited to experienced surfers due to speed and power.
  - Hazards: Overfalls, rips, and unexpected standup sections from the shorter-period NNE energy.

- Velzyland / Points toward Kahuku
  - Expected: Moderate-large depending on local exposure to NNW energy (**5–6 ft** Hawaiian in places).
  - Shape: Breaks that look down-the-line on northwest wraps will score long rides; others a bit lumpier.
  - Who: Intermediate–advanced depending on actual size.

### Conditions & Safety Summary
- Overall: This is a higher-than-normal early‑fall north event. Most exposed reefs will be big and powerful through Oct 7 with a taper on Oct 8. The mix of long-period N energy and shorter-period NNE trains will produce steep, fast waves with a high potential for serious wipeouts and shore impact.
- Skill guidance: Exposed reefs (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) — experienced and expert-only. Some points and protected coves may be rideable by advanced-intermediates if winds are light and they pick sheltered lineups, but be conservative — current and hold‑downs will be significant.
- Equipment: Step‑up and big‑wave boards for the exposed reefs; bigger shortboards/fish/step-up for points; a leash, flotation and surf-with-a-partner protocol strongly recommended.
- If you must paddle out at a busy reef: know exit points, stay out of channels, and respect local priority.

### Comparison To Recent / Normal
- Recent (prior week(s)): If the North Shore had been in a small-to-moderate fall pattern (**2–4 ft** Hawaiian), this event represents a clear increase in size and power — the kind of swell pattern that signals the seasonal transition toward more consistent winter energy.
- Normal for this time of year (early fall): Typical early‑fall North Shore historically runs NW–WNW energy in the 2–6+ ft Hawaiian range. The current mix has stronger true-N components and several **6–7 ft** Hawaiian trains — larger and more sustained than typical early-fall swells. In short: above normal for this date range, trending winter-like at the prime reefs.

### Bottom Line / Surf Windows
- Best short window: Early mornings tend to be lightest wind — if the ESE trades are weak you’ll get the cleanest conditions then. Watch Oct 7 for the peak — that’s the day with the highest potential for very large, world‑class north faces.
- Caution: If the ESE wind strengthens, quality drops and safety risk increases at shallow reefs. Tide will modulate how each reef reacts — lower tides on shallow reefs will make waves steeper and more dangerous.
- Recommended approach: If you’re intermediate and curious, pick the protected points/inside coves, stay conservative with surf craft and timing. If you’re advanced/expert and planning to chase the big breaks, pick windows when winds are light and be prepared with proper support.

If you want, I can:
- Convert these Hawaiian-scale numbers into approximate face heights for each break,
- Give a short predicted size-by-day table for a few named breaks with low/medium/high wind scenarios,
- Or produce a quick checklist for gear/safety and the best windows by sunrise/sunset (requires tide & wind-speed data).

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore surf outlook (Pat Caldwell style)
Dates: 2025-10-06 → 2025-**10-08
S**cale: Hawaiian scale for wave heights (typical Hawaiian ≈ half the face height). I give Hawaiian numbers first, then approximate face heights in parentheses.

Synopsis
- Primary energy: SSE short-period pulse — 1.**6 ft (Hawaiian)** at 13 s. Moderate influence on the South Shore; organized but small.
- Wind: 110° (ESE). Speed not reported — the direction is the important part for shaping conditions: ESE is side-on to cross-on for most central South Shore breaks and will produce texture or onshore push if moderate to fresh.
- Overall: Small, rideable surf for all levels. Best windows if winds remain light; expect onshore texture during any daytime seabreeze or if winds pick up. This is near the low-to-middle end of a normal fall range (typical fall: **1–3 ft** Hawaiian). Not a major south swell — more a tidy, long-period pulse that will favor well-oriented breaks.

Technical swell analysis
- Swell: SSE (around SSE compass bearing) at 1.**6 ft** Hawaiian, 13 s period.
  - Hawaiian→face: 1.**6 ft** H ≈ 3.**2 ft** face on average (varies with local bathymetry).
  - Period effect: 13 s is long enough to deliver organized sets and some push into exposed reefs and bowl-type reefs. It will create cleaner, more rideable peaks than a short-period <10 s bump, but at only 1.**6 ft** H the power will be modest — expect longer but softer lines rather than heavy, hollow walls.
  - Direction effect: SSE energy wraps well into central South Shore reef systems (Ala Moana Bowls, Waikiki reefs) and will also slightly energize Kewalo and the town-point peaks. Spots that face more SSW-SW will get less of this SSE component.

Wind and weather implications (110° / ESE)
- Geometry: ESE winds are side-on to cross-on for the central South Shore. At Waikiki, Canoes and Queens will feel a slight push; Ala Moana Bowls will see side-on chop if winds are light, and a choppy, softened surface if winds strengthen.
- If winds are light (<8–10 kt): expect relatively clean lines, especially in the protected inside areas and on any recessed bowl/reef. Small, punchy peaks will be surfable.
- If winds are moderate to fresh (10–20+ kt): expect general texture and chop, rounded faces and reduced speed. Inside soft-waves (Canoes) will get mushier; outside bowls will lose some snap and hold.
- Weather note: Without speed data, plan for changing texture through the day — early mornings generally calmer; afternoon seabreeze/easterly pick-up will degrade quality.

Timing (build / peak / fade)
- 10/06 (Mon) — Building to small: Energy is present early; expect small but getting more consistent sets through the day. Best early if winds are light.
- 10/07 (Tue) — Near peak: The pulse should be at its most consistent. Small but organized surf through the morning and much of the day. If winds stay light this will be the most surfable day.
- 10/08 (Wed) — Dropping: Swell energy slowly decays; fewer and smaller sets. Expect a noticeable drop in size and punch by late day.

Break-by-break — central South Shore town spots (practical, leveled)
Note: Heights are Hawaiian scale; adjust expectations for tide and local wind.

Waikiki complex (Canoes / Queens / Outrigger)
- Expected size: 1.0–1.**8 ft** H (≈2–3.**6 ft** face) with most peaks near 1.**6 ft** H.
- Profile: Canoes (inside longboard peak) will offer the soft, long lines — best for longboarders and beginners when clean. Queens and the Outrigger peaks will show slightly more push and occasional shoulder but won’t be hollow.
- Timing & tide: Mid to higher tides favor the long inside rides at Canoes; low tide can pull sections onto shallow reef and tighten up waves in a way that’s not useful at this size.
- Wind sensitivity: Side-on ESE will add texture to the faces; if light, surf will be pleasant and long. If winds crank, expect slower, mushier lines.

Ala Moana Bowls / Bowls area
- Expected size: 1.4–1.**8 ft** H (≈2.8–3.**6 ft** face) on sets — bowls will show the best punch from an SSE wrap.
- Profile: Bowls can deliver a faster, more rewarding ride than the inside Waikiki peaks on this swell because of better bottom shape and direct exposure to SSE energy. Don’t expect big walls, but well-shaped mid-length runs are possible on cleaner windows.
- Wind & crowd: Bowls are more exposed to ESE texture; on a calm morning they’ll be the best place to find speed. Crowds can be selective — intermediate surfers should find fun, short to mid-length rides.

Kewalo / Fort / Town-point peaks
- Expected size: 1.2–1.**8 ft** H (≈2.4–3.**6 ft** face).
- Profile: Punchy little peaks and short walls. Fast sections at outgoing tide; these breaks can feel a little hollow on cleaner, longer-period energy but at this small magnitude it’s mostly fun, punchy rides for shortboards and fish shapes.
- Hazard: Shallow, rocky sections — be cautious on low tides.

General suggestions by level
- Beginners: Waikiki inside (Canoes) on the higher tide and the calmest morning sessions. Longboards and paddle practice will be best.
- Intermediates: Queens/Outrigger and Ala Moana Bowls in the morning if winds are light — rideable, engaging lines without heavy sections.
- Advanced: Shortboard riders at Ala Moana Bowls and Kewalo in cleaner windows; when winds back off early, expect the best shape and speed.

Tide considerations & currents
- South Shore typically works on mid to higher tides for longer inside rides at Waikiki. Ala Moana Bowls often prefers mid tidal stages where the reef shapes a clean bowl — at very high or low extremes the shape can change.
- Watch for localized rips and current flows out of Kewalo Basin after higher tides; shallow reef sections can create tricky takeoff zones.

How this compares to recent and normal fall conditions
- Normal fall pattern: primary southerly energy (S to SSW) **1–3 ft** Hawaiian with gradually declining south-swell frequency as the season transitions. This SSE 1.**6 ft** H, 13 s pulse is consistent with late-south-season behavior — not uncommon, but on the lower end of the seasonal size band.
- Compared to recent days (if they were typical late-September to early-October): this is about what you’d expect moving out of prime south-swell season — modest, occasionally tidy pulses rather than sustained, powerful runs. In short: near the lower-middle of normal for early October, but surfable and organized.

Practical tips
- Best bet: early morning sessions before any daytime ESE seabreeze picks up. Check local wind speeds — the quality hinges on how strong that 110° wind is.
- Equipment: longboards and mid-lengths for maximum glide on soft sets; smaller fish or grovel boards for punchy peaks at Ala Moana/Kewalo if you want speed.
- Safety: shallow reef, reef transitions and sudden currents at town points. On smaller swells more people crowd the easy peaks — be mindful.

Bottom line
Small, organized SSE pulse — 1.**6 ft** Hawaiian at 13 s — that will produce longer, softer faces across town peaks. Clean, rideable waves likely during calm morning windows; quality will fall apart if the ESE winds build. Best day for consistency looks like 10/07 if winds remain light; otherwise the whole run is a modest, fun stretch rather than any major South Shore event.

## Daily Forecast

Oahu Surf Report — 2025-10-06 (N swell)

Summary
- Large north swell in from the north. Expect the North Shore to be the focus today with powerful, long-period surf. Morning will be the cleanest window; winds pick up trade/NE by afternoon and make many spots bumpier. Only experienced surfers at exposed North Shore breaks.

Wave heights (Hawaiian scale — Hawaiian numbers typically run about half the face height; multiply by ~2 to estimate face height)
- North Shore (Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa): **6–10 ft** Hawaiian, occasional **12 ft**+ sets (roughly 12–20+ ft face on the biggest sets). Long-period N swell (**14–18s**) — powerful, fast-moving waves.
- Waimea Bay / big-wave locations: 12+ ft Hawaiian on the biggest sets for heavyweight conditions (big wave contest size risk). Only tow-in/bodyboard experts where applicable.
- West/Leeward (Makaha, Kaʻena wrap): **2–4 ft** Hawaiian (wrapping lines, punchy when winds are light).
- East/East-Northeast (Kailua, Lanikai): **2–3 ft** Hawaiian (small wind swell/energy from N with some wrapping; cleaner in morning).
- South Shore (Ala Moana, Waikiki): **1–2 ft** Hawaiian — mostly small and unsurfable for anything other than foamies/longboards.

Wind & weather
- Morning: light NE to variable, 5–10 kt — best window for clean faces on north exposures.
- Afternoon: E–NE trades build 10–18 kt — sideshore to onshore for many north spots, producing chop and disorganized sets.
- Sky: Partly cloudy with isolated showers possible; moderate visibility.

Tide guidance (check local tide table before heading out)
- General: Morning tide window tends to be favorable at many North Shore breaks; mid to high tide often produces better takeoffs at Pipeline and Waimea when the swell is big. Haleiwa/Chuns may work best mid tide — watch current and rips at low tide.
- Practical: If you want more push at reef breaks go closer to mid/high tide; if you’re scouting for sandier, gentler takeoffs head to leeward or east shore at mid/low tide.

Best spots today (by ability)
- Experts only: Pipeline (Ehukai), Backdoor, Sunset, Waimea Bay (big wave zone). Extremely powerful — assess conditions and lifeguard advisories.
- Advanced/intermediate (smaller sections of North Shore or sheltered breaks): Haleiwa Aliʻi/Banzai area (seek inside breaks), Chuns Reef when smaller; Makaha for west-facing sanctuary if swell wraps and winds are light.
- Intermediates/longboarders: East side in the morning (Kailua/Lanikai) for cleaner, smaller surf; protected leeward pockets if available.
- Avoid: South Shore — negligible; inexperienced surfers should avoid exposed north reefs today.

Changing conditions through the day
- Swell: Likely near peak in the morning, holding through the day then slowly easing into the evening. Expect long-period sets all day.
- Winds: Light and cleaner in the early morning — pickup from the E/NE in the afternoon will make many north exposures choppy and more dangerous.
- Safety: Currents, rips and heavy shorebreaks will be strong on big sets — conditions can change rapidly with incoming sets.

Safety reminders
- Check lifeguard flags and local advisories before entering. For big north swells, only go where you have big-wave experience or appropriate support (spotters, jet-ski/tow if applicable).
- Look at NOAA buoy data, local webcams, and tide tables before committing. Wear appropriate gear, and don’t surf alone in exposed big-swell breaks.

If you want, I can pull together a quick checklist for your session (best morning windows by spot, what gear to bring, and which webcams/NOAA buoys to watch).
