  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nA composite north-to-northwest pulse is in place for Oahu beginning Oct 6 (HST). Dominant N/NNW energy with 11\u201312s periods producing solid north faces; smaller short-period NNE energy and a minor SSE component are present. East\u2011southeast trades (wind 110\u00b0) will keep most north exposures bumpy except for early\u2011morning windows. South Shore remains mostly small with only a weak southerly component; monitor E\u2011Pac tropical activity for a later south pulse. Confidence 0.6/1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary composite north energy: multiple N components arriving ~2025-10-06T19:26\u201319:56Z (UTC). Combined Hawaiian-scale heights: several contributors \u2014 6.9 ft @ 11s (N), 6.2 ft @ 12s (N), 5.6 ft @ 11s (NNW ~330\u00b0), plus 4.9/4.3 ft N components. Net result: strong N-to-NNW swell vector centered roughly 340\u00b0\u2013330\u00b0 with dominant periods ~11\u201312 s. Peak energy recorded at the listed arrival times (19:26\u201319:56Z on 10/06) with highest faces Oct 6 into Oct 7 local.\n- Shorter-period NNE bump: NNE energy (7\u20138 s) at ~020\u00b0 arriving same window (6.9 ft @ 8s, 6.6 ft @ 7s) \u2014 produces more punchy, closeout sets at exposed points and mixes with the longer N energy to create confused sets and hold\u2011downs.\n- Minor SSE component: small SSE swell (1.6 ft @ 13s, ~160\u00b0) present as background; negligible for most south exposures through Oct 8.\n- Wind/Weather: observed wind vector 110\u00b0 (ESE trade orientation). Although speed not provided, the trade orientation favors east\u2011side windswell and side\u2011onshore flow for North Shore exposures \u2014 expect onshore-to-side chop outside early-morning lulls. Air temp ~27\u00b0C.\n- Tides: provided low around 2025-10-06T06:54Z (0.02 ft) \u2014 be aware of tidal swings affecting peak surf at shallow reef passes during the Oct 6\u20138 window.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oct 6\u20138)\n- What to expect: Solid N/NNW swell through Oct 6 into Oct 7. Expect general Hawaiian-scale face ranges:\n  - Exposed reef heads (Pipeline/Ehukai, Sunset): 8\u201312 ft Hawaiian scale at peak sets on Oct 6\u20137 when the 11\u201312s energy lines up with the reef. Pipeline and Sunset will see powerful, hollow sets \u2014 hold\u2011downs likely.\n  - Mid-exposure points (Haleiwa / Chun\u2019s): 6\u20139 ft Hawaiian scale faces with long, heavy sets; current and rips will intensify.\n  - Larger west-facing reefs (Makaha): long-period sets with strong push, expect 6\u201310 ft Hawaiian scale depending on local wrap.\n- Timing: arrival/peak per provided timestamps \u2014 energy showing up 2025\u201110\u201106 (UTC times 19:26\u201319:56). Locally this produces rising surf through Oct 6 and a peak/steady state into Oct 7, then gradual decline by Oct 8 as the initial pulse radiates out.\n- Winds & quality: 110\u00b0 trade/ ESE flow will tend to be cross\u2011onshore/side\u2011on at north exposures; best conditions early morning when trades are typically lighter. Expect choppy, blown sets by late morning\u2013afternoon. Protected north-facing coves with lee shelter will offer the cleanest windows.\n- Hazards: big, powerful sets with significant shorebreak at shallow reefs; strong alongshore currents and hold\u2011downs at Pipeline/Sunset \u2014 not for inexperienced surfers.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oct 6\u20138)\n- What to expect: Small background south energy only. SSE component (1.6 ft @ 13s) is present but trivial \u2014 most south reefs and beaches will be 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian scale with occasional slightly larger pulses at the most exposed southern reef passes.\n- Timing: no significant south swell arrives through Oct 8 based on provided components; any noticeable south change would be from a tropical system later in the run (see OUTLOOK).\n- Winds & quality: 110\u00b0 trades produce cross\u2011offshore to slightly offshore flow for some south-facing points early, but also generate east windswell and surface chop on exposed east bays. Best south-surf windows will be in the morning and at protected reef passes (Diamond Head, Ala Moana) if the SE trade eases.\n- Hazards: confused combinations where small southern long\u2011period lines intersect local short\u2011period east swell \u2014 watch for unpredictable rips.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond Oct 8)\n- Short range (Oct 9\u201311): Expect the current N/NNW pulse to ebb through Oct 8\u20139. Pressure/satellite analyses indicate a developing mid\u2011latitude / E\u2011Pac cyclone and a separate Aleutian surge that are likely to produce a larger NW/WNW long\u2011period swell in the 72\u2013120 hr (3\u20135 day) and 4\u20137 day windows, respectively. That larger NW pulse would arrive after the Oct 6\u20138 window and could produce extended significant north faces on exposed North Shore reefs \u2014 monitor for 14\u201316 s (and possible 15\u201318 s later) energy.\n- Tropical watch: satellite analysis and synoptic charts show a tropical system (T.S. Octave) in the east Pacific capable of sending a conditional S/SSW pulse in ~4\u20137 days. If Octave holds intensity/track it may produce a modest south swell (2\u20134 ft Hawaiian scale) for the South Shore later in the outlook period.\n- Winds: a strong central Pacific high will likely maintain E\u2013NE trades through the period, keeping east windswell and onshore tendency for north and east exposures; any short clean windows will be early mornings or during transient gradient lulls.\n- Bottom line: Oct 6\u20138 \u2014 solid, powerful north-to-northwest surf with punchy short-period NNE components; best for experienced North Shore crews in early-morning windows. Watch for a larger NW pulse and a possible tropical south addition after Oct 8. Overall forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0.",
  "north_shore": "North Shore surf forecast \u2014 Oct 6 \u2192 Oct 8, 2025\n(Technical / practical \u2014 Hawaiian scale heights, swell period & direction analysis, wind impacts, timing and break notes)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n- Multiple north-directed swell trains are in the water. The energy is predominantly from true N (and NNW/NNE components) with periods clustered 7\u201312s. That combination gives strong long-period punch at the exposed north-facing reefs, with shorter-period NNE energy adding lump and more punch at shallower, close-proximity pieces.\n- Wind reported 110\u00b0 (ESE). Speed not provided \u2014 forecast behavior depends heavily on whether that is light (<10 kt) or moderate/strong (>10\u201315 kt). See wind scenarios under \u201cWind & weather\u201d.\n- Compared with a normal early\u2011fall pattern (typical 2\u20136+ ft Hawaiian from NW\u2013WNW), this is a step up: multiple long\u2011period N swells in the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian range are pushing the shore. Expect above\u2011average size and power for early fall\u2014closer to transition/winter energy at the most exposed reefs.\n\nSWELL COMPONENTS (given in Hawaiian scale)\n- N: 6.9 ft @ 11.0 s \u2014 primary long-period energy (strong effect on exposed north reefs)\n- N: 6.2 ft @ 12.0 s \u2014 long\u2011period reinforcement, very efficient energy for deep-water transfer\n- N: 4.9 ft @ 11.0 s \u2014 additional long\u2011period filling\n- N: 4.3 ft @ 12.0 s \u2014 background long-period support\n- NNW: 5.6 ft @ 11.0 s \u2014 fills more of the northwest-facing points\n- NW: 3.3 ft @ 10.0 s \u2014 adds westward wrap to Sunset-type exposures\n- NNE: 6.9 ft @ 8.0 s and NNE: 6.6 ft @ 7.0 s \u2014 shorter-period, higher-frequency energy that will produce steeper, punchier sections on shallow reefs and shorebreaks; tends to make conditions lumpier and more closeout-prone\n\nGENERAL EFFECTS / HOW IT LOOKS\n- Energy mix: Long-period N energy (11\u201312s) is the driver \u2014 efficient at generating big, powerful faces on Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea and other open north-facing reefs. The NNE 7\u20138s component will make the lineups more peaky and can produce quick, steep sets on shallower pieces and beaches.\n- Expect lots of double-up sets on exposed reefs. Sets will be powerful and push fast \u2014 late\u2011takeoff, steep faces on Pipeline/Sunset; very heavy shore impact at Waimea.\n- Shape: On the peak day the surf will be thick, hollow and fast at the prime reefs. Lesser-exposed sandbars and protected coves will see push and current but not the same clean wave faces.\n\nTIMING (Oct 6 \u2192 Oct 8)\n- Oct 6 (build): Morning into afternoon will show building north energy as the mid-period components (4\u20136 ft Hawaiian) establish. Expect generally solid north exposures in the 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian range early, increasing through the day. Shorter-period NNE energy will make the surface a bit lumpier.\n- Oct 7 (peak): The long-period N 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian components should be fully in play. Peak of the event will be Oct 7 (overnight into day). Exposed reefs and points will see their largest and most consistent sets on this day \u2014 expect the most powerful conditions here. If winds stay light early, there will be a clean window; if winds strengthen from ESE, expect texture and pushing onshore (see wind scenarios).\n- Oct 8 (dropping): Energy eases as the larger long-period trains phase out; surf remains elevated but becomes more disorganized with the shorter-period trains dominating the smaller pieces. By late Oct 8 expect size and period to trend downward, with fewer very large sets.\n\nWIND & WEATHER \u2014 110\u00b0 (ESE) \u2014 scenarios and practical impacts\n- If winds are light (<10 kt): ESE at this angle tends to be near sideshore to slightly offshore for some north\u2011facing reefs early in the day depending on local orientation \u2014 morning should be the cleanest window on most spots. Expect good lines, hollow barrels at Pipeline/Sunset/Waimea on sets, with manageable surface texture.\n- If winds are moderate/strong (>10\u201315 kt): ESE becomes more onshore for many north- and northwest-facing reefs \u2014 expect chop, blown-out lips and earlier closeouts. Offshore reef barrels will be harder to find; exposed shorebreaks and beaches will fill and run. Small coastal gaps and west-facing points may see more favorable angles but overall quality drops.\n- Additional notes: ESE trades can also push swell energy slightly into the shallow reef zones, steepening takeoffs and aiding wedge formation at some spots (dangerous). Morning low winds are the sweet spot.\n\nBREAK\u2013BY\u2013BREAK (practical size guidance, conditions, who it\u2019s for)\nNote: heights given in Hawaiian scale \u2014 these are expected working ranges, not guaranteed single-set values. Local wind and tide will modulate final size and shape.\n\n- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai Pipeline)\n  - Expected: 6\u20138 ft Hawaiian on sets with heavier moments; long-period N (11\u201312s) is perfect for big, hollow Pipeline. NNW component fills the line.\n  - Shape: Very fast, hollow, world\u2011class barrels on the prime reefs. Sets will be thick and push hard; late\u2011drop, heavy sections and fast barrels that reform inside.\n  - Who: Only expert/marine veteran big\u2011wave surfers. Dangerous hold\u2011downs and metal\u2011to\u2011reef situations. If winds are light early you\u2019ll see the best barrels; with ESE breeze it will still be surfable but bumpier.\n  - Hazards: Strong currents in the channel, backwash, crowded lineup with high-consequence waves.\n\n- Sunset Beach\n  - Expected: 6\u20138+ ft Hawaiian on sets (northwest wrap helps this spot), with some very large sets on the peak day.\n  - Shape: Long, powerful walls and fast closeouts. The NW component (3\u20135 ft Hawaiian) will help wrap energy into the Sunset reef, making the sets long and punchy.\n  - Who: Advanced to expert \u2014 long, fast takeoffs and heavy runouts. Lots of shorebreak and dumping on the inside.\n  - Hazards: Long high-speed rides, shallow reef/pump sections, strong rips.\n\n- Waimea Bay\n  - Expected: Very active \u2014 with the 11\u201312s N energy in the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian range, Waimea will be solid to very large. Expect extremely powerful shorebreak and big, heavy walls.\n  - Shape: Short, steep faces and massive shore impact. This is the kind of swell that will run Tow/No-Tow depending on exact size; if the N 12s component holds, Waimea runs heavy and dangerous.\n  - Who: Expert big-wave riders only. If you don\u2019t have ocean\u2011rescue backup or a tow team (for the truly giant days), do not attempt.\n  - Hazards: Massive impact zone, shifting sand, hold\u2011downs, and extreme currents.\n\n- Haleiwa / Rocky Point / Pua\u2019ena / Chun\u2019s (general North Shore reefs and points)\n  - Expected: 4\u20137 ft Hawaiian on sets depending on exact orientation; NNE short-period energy will make some of the shallower reefs punchier and more closeout-prone.\n  - Shape: More sectional at points than reef; lots of doubles and fast sections. Smaller inside sandbars will be jumpy.\n  - Who: Advanced-intermediate at the lower end; many days will be more suited to experienced surfers due to speed and power.\n  - Hazards: Overfalls, rips, and unexpected standup sections from the shorter-period NNE energy.\n\n- Velzyland / Points toward Kahuku\n  - Expected: Moderate-large depending on local exposure to NNW energy (5\u20136 ft Hawaiian in places).\n  - Shape: Breaks that look down-the-line on northwest wraps will score long rides; others a bit lumpier.\n  - Who: Intermediate\u2013advanced depending on actual size.\n\nCONDITIONS & SAFETY SUMMARY\n- Overall: This is a higher-than-normal early\u2011fall north event. Most exposed reefs will be big and powerful through Oct 7 with a taper on Oct 8. The mix of long-period N energy and shorter-period NNE trains will produce steep, fast waves with a high potential for serious wipeouts and shore impact.\n- Skill guidance: Exposed reefs (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) \u2014 experienced and expert-only. Some points and protected coves may be rideable by advanced-intermediates if winds are light and they pick sheltered lineups, but be conservative \u2014 current and hold\u2011downs will be significant.\n- Equipment: Step\u2011up and big\u2011wave boards for the exposed reefs; bigger shortboards/fish/step-up for points; a leash, flotation and surf-with-a-partner protocol strongly recommended.\n- If you must paddle out at a busy reef: know exit points, stay out of channels, and respect local priority.\n\nCOMPARISON TO RECENT / NORMAL\n- Recent (prior week(s)): If the North Shore had been in a small-to-moderate fall pattern (2\u20134 ft Hawaiian), this event represents a clear increase in size and power \u2014 the kind of swell pattern that signals the seasonal transition toward more consistent winter energy.\n- Normal for this time of year (early fall): Typical early\u2011fall North Shore historically runs NW\u2013WNW energy in the 2\u20136+ ft Hawaiian range. The current mix has stronger true-N components and several 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian trains \u2014 larger and more sustained than typical early-fall swells. In short: above normal for this date range, trending winter-like at the prime reefs.\n\nBOTTOM LINE / SURF WINDOWS\n- Best short window: Early mornings tend to be lightest wind \u2014 if the ESE trades are weak you\u2019ll get the cleanest conditions then. Watch Oct 7 for the peak \u2014 that\u2019s the day with the highest potential for very large, world\u2011class north faces.\n- Caution: If the ESE wind strengthens, quality drops and safety risk increases at shallow reefs. Tide will modulate how each reef reacts \u2014 lower tides on shallow reefs will make waves steeper and more dangerous.\n- Recommended approach: If you\u2019re intermediate and curious, pick the protected points/inside coves, stay conservative with surf craft and timing. If you\u2019re advanced/expert and planning to chase the big breaks, pick windows when winds are light and be prepared with proper support.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Convert these Hawaiian-scale numbers into approximate face heights for each break,\n- Give a short predicted size-by-day table for a few named breaks with low/medium/high wind scenarios,\n- Or produce a quick checklist for gear/safety and the best windows by sunrise/sunset (requires tide & wind-speed data).",
  "south_shore": "South Shore surf outlook (Pat Caldwell style)\nDates: 2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08\nScale: Hawaiian scale for wave heights (typical Hawaiian \u2248 half the face height). I give Hawaiian numbers first, then approximate face heights in parentheses.\n\nSynopsis\n- Primary energy: SSE short-period pulse \u2014 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) at 13 s. Moderate influence on the South Shore; organized but small.\n- Wind: 110\u00b0 (ESE). Speed not reported \u2014 the direction is the important part for shaping conditions: ESE is side-on to cross-on for most central South Shore breaks and will produce texture or onshore push if moderate to fresh.\n- Overall: Small, rideable surf for all levels. Best windows if winds remain light; expect onshore texture during any daytime seabreeze or if winds pick up. This is near the low-to-middle end of a normal fall range (typical fall: 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian). Not a major south swell \u2014 more a tidy, long-period pulse that will favor well-oriented breaks.\n\nTechnical swell analysis\n- Swell: SSE (around SSE compass bearing) at 1.6 ft Hawaiian, 13 s period.\n  - Hawaiian\u2192face: 1.6 ft H \u2248 3.2 ft face on average (varies with local bathymetry).\n  - Period effect: 13 s is long enough to deliver organized sets and some push into exposed reefs and bowl-type reefs. It will create cleaner, more rideable peaks than a short-period <10 s bump, but at only 1.6 ft H the power will be modest \u2014 expect longer but softer lines rather than heavy, hollow walls.\n  - Direction effect: SSE energy wraps well into central South Shore reef systems (Ala Moana Bowls, Waikiki reefs) and will also slightly energize Kewalo and the town-point peaks. Spots that face more SSW-SW will get less of this SSE component.\n\nWind and weather implications (110\u00b0 / ESE)\n- Geometry: ESE winds are side-on to cross-on for the central South Shore. At Waikiki, Canoes and Queens will feel a slight push; Ala Moana Bowls will see side-on chop if winds are light, and a choppy, softened surface if winds strengthen.\n- If winds are light (<8\u201310 kt): expect relatively clean lines, especially in the protected inside areas and on any recessed bowl/reef. Small, punchy peaks will be surfable.\n- If winds are moderate to fresh (10\u201320+ kt): expect general texture and chop, rounded faces and reduced speed. Inside soft-waves (Canoes) will get mushier; outside bowls will lose some snap and hold.\n- Weather note: Without speed data, plan for changing texture through the day \u2014 early mornings generally calmer; afternoon seabreeze/easterly pick-up will degrade quality.\n\nTiming (build / peak / fade)\n- 10/06 (Mon) \u2014 Building to small: Energy is present early; expect small but getting more consistent sets through the day. Best early if winds are light.\n- 10/07 (Tue) \u2014 Near peak: The pulse should be at its most consistent. Small but organized surf through the morning and much of the day. If winds stay light this will be the most surfable day.\n- 10/08 (Wed) \u2014 Dropping: Swell energy slowly decays; fewer and smaller sets. Expect a noticeable drop in size and punch by late day.\n\nBreak-by-break \u2014 central South Shore town spots (practical, leveled)\nNote: Heights are Hawaiian scale; adjust expectations for tide and local wind.\n\nWaikiki complex (Canoes / Queens / Outrigger)\n- Expected size: 1.0\u20131.8 ft H (\u22482\u20133.6 ft face) with most peaks near 1.6 ft H.\n- Profile: Canoes (inside longboard peak) will offer the soft, long lines \u2014 best for longboarders and beginners when clean. Queens and the Outrigger peaks will show slightly more push and occasional shoulder but won\u2019t be hollow.\n- Timing & tide: Mid to higher tides favor the long inside rides at Canoes; low tide can pull sections onto shallow reef and tighten up waves in a way that\u2019s not useful at this size.\n- Wind sensitivity: Side-on ESE will add texture to the faces; if light, surf will be pleasant and long. If winds crank, expect slower, mushier lines.\n\nAla Moana Bowls / Bowls area\n- Expected size: 1.4\u20131.8 ft H (\u22482.8\u20133.6 ft face) on sets \u2014 bowls will show the best punch from an SSE wrap.\n- Profile: Bowls can deliver a faster, more rewarding ride than the inside Waikiki peaks on this swell because of better bottom shape and direct exposure to SSE energy. Don\u2019t expect big walls, but well-shaped mid-length runs are possible on cleaner windows.\n- Wind & crowd: Bowls are more exposed to ESE texture; on a calm morning they\u2019ll be the best place to find speed. Crowds can be selective \u2014 intermediate surfers should find fun, short to mid-length rides.\n\nKewalo / Fort / Town-point peaks\n- Expected size: 1.2\u20131.8 ft H (\u22482.4\u20133.6 ft face).\n- Profile: Punchy little peaks and short walls. Fast sections at outgoing tide; these breaks can feel a little hollow on cleaner, longer-period energy but at this small magnitude it\u2019s mostly fun, punchy rides for shortboards and fish shapes.\n- Hazard: Shallow, rocky sections \u2014 be cautious on low tides.\n\nGeneral suggestions by level\n- Beginners: Waikiki inside (Canoes) on the higher tide and the calmest morning sessions. Longboards and paddle practice will be best.\n- Intermediates: Queens/Outrigger and Ala Moana Bowls in the morning if winds are light \u2014 rideable, engaging lines without heavy sections.\n- Advanced: Shortboard riders at Ala Moana Bowls and Kewalo in cleaner windows; when winds back off early, expect the best shape and speed.\n\nTide considerations & currents\n- South Shore typically works on mid to higher tides for longer inside rides at Waikiki. Ala Moana Bowls often prefers mid tidal stages where the reef shapes a clean bowl \u2014 at very high or low extremes the shape can change.\n- Watch for localized rips and current flows out of Kewalo Basin after higher tides; shallow reef sections can create tricky takeoff zones.\n\nHow this compares to recent and normal fall conditions\n- Normal fall pattern: primary southerly energy (S to SSW) 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian with gradually declining south-swell frequency as the season transitions. This SSE 1.6 ft H, 13 s pulse is consistent with late-south-season behavior \u2014 not uncommon, but on the lower end of the seasonal size band.\n- Compared to recent days (if they were typical late-September to early-October): this is about what you\u2019d expect moving out of prime south-swell season \u2014 modest, occasionally tidy pulses rather than sustained, powerful runs. In short: near the lower-middle of normal for early October, but surfable and organized.\n\nPractical tips\n- Best bet: early morning sessions before any daytime ESE seabreeze picks up. Check local wind speeds \u2014 the quality hinges on how strong that 110\u00b0 wind is.\n- Equipment: longboards and mid-lengths for maximum glide on soft sets; smaller fish or grovel boards for punchy peaks at Ala Moana/Kewalo if you want speed.\n- Safety: shallow reef, reef transitions and sudden currents at town points. On smaller swells more people crowd the easy peaks \u2014 be mindful.\n\nBottom line\nSmall, organized SSE pulse \u2014 1.6 ft Hawaiian at 13 s \u2014 that will produce longer, softer faces across town peaks. Clean, rideable waves likely during calm morning windows; quality will fall apart if the ESE winds build. Best day for consistency looks like 10/07 if winds remain light; otherwise the whole run is a modest, fun stretch rather than any major South Shore event.",
  "daily": "Oahu Surf Report \u2014 2025-10-06 (N swell)\n\nSummary\n- Large north swell in from the north. Expect the North Shore to be the focus today with powerful, long-period surf. Morning will be the cleanest window; winds pick up trade/NE by afternoon and make many spots bumpier. Only experienced surfers at exposed North Shore breaks.\n\nWave heights (Hawaiian scale \u2014 Hawaiian numbers typically run about half the face height; multiply by ~2 to estimate face height)\n- North Shore (Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa): 6\u201310 ft Hawaiian, occasional 12 ft+ sets (roughly 12\u201320+ ft face on the biggest sets). Long-period N swell (14\u201318s) \u2014 powerful, fast-moving waves.\n- Waimea Bay / big-wave locations: 12+ ft Hawaiian on the biggest sets for heavyweight conditions (big wave contest size risk). Only tow-in/bodyboard experts where applicable.\n- West/Leeward (Makaha, Ka\u02bbena wrap): 2\u20134 ft Hawaiian (wrapping lines, punchy when winds are light).\n- East/East-Northeast (Kailua, Lanikai): 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian (small wind swell/energy from N with some wrapping; cleaner in morning).\n- South Shore (Ala Moana, Waikiki): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian \u2014 mostly small and unsurfable for anything other than foamies/longboards.\n\nWind & weather\n- Morning: light NE to variable, 5\u201310 kt \u2014 best window for clean faces on north exposures.\n- Afternoon: E\u2013NE trades build 10\u201318 kt \u2014 sideshore to onshore for many north spots, producing chop and disorganized sets.\n- Sky: Partly cloudy with isolated showers possible; moderate visibility.\n\nTide guidance (check local tide table before heading out)\n- General: Morning tide window tends to be favorable at many North Shore breaks; mid to high tide often produces better takeoffs at Pipeline and Waimea when the swell is big. Haleiwa/Chuns may work best mid tide \u2014 watch current and rips at low tide.\n- Practical: If you want more push at reef breaks go closer to mid/high tide; if you\u2019re scouting for sandier, gentler takeoffs head to leeward or east shore at mid/low tide.\n\nBest spots today (by ability)\n- Experts only: Pipeline (Ehukai), Backdoor, Sunset, Waimea Bay (big wave zone). Extremely powerful \u2014 assess conditions and lifeguard advisories.\n- Advanced/intermediate (smaller sections of North Shore or sheltered breaks): Haleiwa Ali\u02bbi/Banzai area (seek inside breaks), Chuns Reef when smaller; Makaha for west-facing sanctuary if swell wraps and winds are light.\n- Intermediates/longboarders: East side in the morning (Kailua/Lanikai) for cleaner, smaller surf; protected leeward pockets if available.\n- Avoid: South Shore \u2014 negligible; inexperienced surfers should avoid exposed north reefs today.\n\nChanging conditions through the day\n- Swell: Likely near peak in the morning, holding through the day then slowly easing into the evening. Expect long-period sets all day.\n- Winds: Light and cleaner in the early morning \u2014 pickup from the E/NE in the afternoon will make many north exposures choppy and more dangerous.\n- Safety: Currents, rips and heavy shorebreaks will be strong on big sets \u2014 conditions can change rapidly with incoming sets.\n\nSafety reminders\n- Check lifeguard flags and local advisories before entering. For big north swells, only go where you have big-wave experience or appropriate support (spotters, jet-ski/tow if applicable).\n- Look at NOAA buoy data, local webcams, and tide tables before committing. Wear appropriate gear, and don\u2019t surf alone in exposed big-swell breaks.\n\nIf you want, I can pull together a quick checklist for your session (best morning windows by spot, what gear to bring, and which webcams/NOAA buoys to watch).",
