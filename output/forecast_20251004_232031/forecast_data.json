  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nMedium-period NNW pulse arrives Friday morning (Oct 4) \u2014 multiple components combining to 7\u20138 ft (Hawaiian) at 11\u201313s with smaller 10s energy filling in. Short-period ENE/E wind-seas (5\u20136 ft @ 6\u20137s) arrive same morning. Small SSW 15s pulse present but minor for the south shore. Morning conditions Friday should be the cleanest window; trades rebuild through the weekend and will rough up east/south exposures. Confidence: 0.7/1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary NNW pulse (\u2248330\u00b0): 7.5 ft (Hawaiian) at 13.0 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-04 11:20 HST. Backed by an 11 s component 7.2 ft (Hawaiian) also peaking 11:20 HST and a smaller 10 s component 3.3 ft (Hawaiian) at 10:26 HST. Expect the NNW energy to be strongest mid-late Friday morning, holding into Friday afternoon and gradually easing through Saturday and Sunday.\n- Short-period ENE / E wind-seas (\u2248070\u2013090\u00b0): 5.6 ft (Hawaiian) at 6\u20137 s (multiple components) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-04 ~11:20\u201311:26 HST. This is local wind/wind-swell energy that will increase lump on east-facing points and add close-out sets at exposed reefs.\n- SSW background pulse (\u2248200\u00b0): 3.0 ft (Hawaiian) at 15 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-04 11:30 HST. Long enough period to show improvement on protected south spots but small in size.\n- Minor SSE short-period energy 2.6 ft @ 6 s peaking 11:30 HST \u2014 negligible except building chop on southeastern shores.\n\nTiming/shape: Peak arrival window Friday 10:30\u201312:00 HST for all listed components. The NNW medium-period swell will produce largest faces Friday morning through afternoon, then slowly decline over Saturday into Sunday as swell rays disperse and energy falls off. ENE short-period energy is local and will respond quickly to winds \u2014 expect increase/degradation as trades strengthen.\n\nSynoptic context (integrated): The current NNW/NNW-ish energy is tied to Central North Pacific frontal activity and early Aleutian fetch. The large 970 mb Aleutian storm and adjacent frontal lows will continue to generate longer-period NW energy over the next several days \u2014 expect an additional, longer-period NW swell to arrive later in the week beyond this window. A strong subtropical high south/SE of the islands is rebuilding and will reinforce E-NE trades, so winds will trend onshore for east/south exposures by Saturday\u2013Sunday.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- General: NNW 7\u20138 ft (Hawaiian) at 11\u201313s will produce solid north and northwest faces Friday. Best quality early in the morning when local winds are light from ~60\u00b0 (calm in the data) \u2014 expect the cleanest conditions 8\u201311 AM HST Friday.\n- Pipeline / Ehukai: Expect solid overhead to double-overhead faces on sets. Hawaiian-scale 7\u20138 ft translates to very large, powerful surf on exposed reef sections \u2014 hold for sizeable sets, heavy shorebreak and dangerous currents. Best in the clean morning window; will get gnarley with onshores/trade build later.\n- Sunset / Haleiwa: Sunset will see large, powerful lefts \u2014 Sunset may show peak faces near double-overhead on large sets. Haleiwa will pick up strong north-northwest wraps with long, powerful rides on favorable tide windows; expect strong currents at the rock shelf and break on the channel.\n- Quality and hazards: With 11\u201313 s periods the energy will be punchy and organized \u2014 expect long, powerful sets and strong rip currents. If trades remain light Friday morning the north-facing breaks will be rideable to excellent for experienced surfers; as trades strengthen (Sat onward) expect lump and surface chop and a deterioration at exposed points.\n- Timing: Primary window Friday 08:30\u201315:00 HST with peak around 11:00 HST. Decline into Saturday, but leftover medium-period energy will keep notable size through the weekend.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- General: South-facing exposures will see modest background energy. The SSW 3.0 ft @ 15 s pulse is long enough to create usable surf at the most sheltered southern reefs and points, but size will be small on an absolute scale.\n- Waikiki / Ala Moana / Diamond Head: Expect small but surfable waist- to chest-high (Hawaiian-scale ~2\u20133 ft) conditions at the most protected south-facing reef breaks on Friday, particularly on incoming swell windows and favorable tides. Longer-period 15 s energy will make peaks more rideable than the short-period seas alone, but overall limited.\n- Influence of ENE short-period energy: The 5\u20136 s ENE/E wind-seas will generate bump and closeouts on east-southeast facing breaks (including Diamond Head side) \u2014 expect choppy, onshore-influenced conditions especially as trades pick up.\n- Quality and hazards: Best south spots will be protected points with small longer-period energy giving cleaner faces in the morning. Trade build will create cross-onshore chop later in the day.\n\nWIND / WEATHER NOTES\n- Current wind vector in the input is 60\u00b0 at 0 kt \u2014 effectively calm ENE in the immediate data set. That yields a clean morning window Friday, particularly for north-facing breaks.\n- Synoptic pressure pattern (subtropical high ~1023\u20131025 south/SE of Hawaii) will reinforce E-NE trades through the weekend. Expect winds to trend from light Friday morning toward moderate trades (15\u201320+ kt) by Saturday and Sunday afternoons, increasing surface chop on east and south exposures and making many spots rattle.\n- Air temperature ~31\u00b0C \u2014 warm water/surface temps.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond Oct 6)\n- Short term (Oct 5\u20136): NNW energy will slowly decay but remain noticeable at exposed north-facing breaks Saturday, dropping further by Sunday as the medium-period components disperse and shorter-period energy dominates. Trades increase, degrading open-ocean faces on exposed breaks.\n- Mid-range (Oct 7\u201310): The Aleutian storm and adjacent frontal fetches analyzed on the pressure charts have high potential to send a longer-period NW swell into Hawaii in the 3\u20135 day range after the initial pulse. Expect a follow-up long-period NW swell (longer than the current 11\u201313s energy) with potential for larger faces \u2014 monitor model updates. Concurrently, tropical systems (Octave / TD 28W) may produce southerly energy around the same mid-range window (~4\u20136 days); however the subtropical high may limit direct south-energy transmission, so south-shore impacts are possible but uncertain.\n- Hazard note: If the Aleutian storm maintains intensity and fetch, next-week NW swell could be significantly larger and longer-period than the current pulse \u2014 prepare for bigger, more hazardous north and northwest surf later in the week.\n\nOverall Forecast Confidence: 0.7/1.0 \u2014 medium confidence in the timing and size of the current NNW pulse and high confidence that trades will build this weekend; moderate uncertainty on the amplitude/timing of the larger long-period NW swell and any tropical southern pulse beyond Oct 6.",
  "north_shore": "Short version\n- Expect a mixed, NNW-dominant period with significant size for exposed North Shore reefs Oct 4\u20136. If the larger NNW pulses are long-period energy (see data note below) this is a heavy, fast, short-interval North Shore setup \u2014 powerful pits at Pipeline and Sunset and serious Waimea conditions. If those NNW pulses are short-period, expect punchy, closeout-prone surf with heavy shorebreak and messy cross-seas from the ENE/E components. Mornings likely cleaner; afternoons prone to trade chop if typical seasonal ENE winds fill in.\n\nData note / important caveat\n- The swell list you supplied has no periods (all 0.0 s) and the wind entry is internally inconsistent. Period and wind direction/speed are critical to an accurate forecast. I\u2019ll proceed using the given Hawaiian-scale heights and realistic assumptions for period and wind typical for early October on the North Shore:\n  - Assumed periods: the big NNW pulses (7.5, 7.2 ft H) \u2014 treat as longer-period groundswell (14\u201316 s) unless you can confirm shorter values. The smaller NNW (3.3 ft H) and the ENE/E components are treated as shorter-period, locally generated swell/sea (8\u201311 s).\n  - Assumed winds: typical seasonal pattern \u2014 light/variable to slightly offshore early AM, with trades building from ENE\u2013ESE during the day to 8\u201318 kt. I\u2019ll flag how different wind outcomes would change the picture.\n\nHow to read the Hawaiian numbers here\n- I\u2019m using the Hawaiian scale as given. These are the commonly used local shorthand; face heights will be significantly larger (expect faces roughly 1.5\u20132\u00d7 Hawaiian in real-world feel depending on the spot and set). 7\u20137.5 ft Hawaiian on the North Shore = very large, dangerous, world-class big-wave territory on exposed reefs.\n\nSwell analysis (combined effects)\n- Primary energy: NNW series \u2014 you\u2019ve got multiple NNW components (7.5 ft H and 7.2 ft H plus a smaller 3.3 ft H). If those two ~7 ft pulses are in the 12\u201316 s range they will dominate the North Shore: long-period, powerful, well-organized lines that translate into steep, hollow reef breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea).\n- Secondary energy: ENE / E components in the 3.9\u20135.6 ft H range. Those are moderate and will act as a cross-sea to the NNW, potentially making the surface messy and filling in spots that respond to more easterly angles (some inside-rights and beachbreaks). If the ENE energy is locally generated with shorter period, expect confused short-period sets superimposed on the long-period NNW train \u2014 tricky, punchy closeouts on top of powerful footholds.\n- Net effect: A large NNW groundtrain with a moderate ENE cross-sea \u2014 powerful, fast-open faces where the reef is well oriented to NNW; sloppy and confused in places that are exposed to the ENE component. Current and rips will be strong.\n\nTiming overview (Oct 4\u20136)\n- Oct 4 (Fri) \u2014 Building: NNW energy begins to come up. Expect the North Shore to go from surfable to contest-scale in exposed spots through the day. Morning cleaner; watch for rising sets late day.\n- Oct 5 (Sat) \u2014 Peak window: the larger NNW pulses should be at or near peak. If periods are long, this will be the day with the heaviest, most hollow surf \u2014 Pipeline and Sunset likely to be at their most dangerous. ENE overlay may increase surface texture and cross-seas into the afternoon.\n- Oct 6 (Sun) \u2014 Dropping / residuals: the largest chunks diminish but long-period swell energy lingers; expect big, but gradually easing lines. The ENE component may still cause confusion on the surface; tides and winds will govern re-shaping of the day.\n\nWind and weather influences\n- Best case (most common early-October pattern): light/variable or light offshore N\u2013NW in pre-dawn \u2014 very clean windows on the reefs for the AM sets. Trades (ENE\u2013ESE) fill in midday to afternoon 8\u201318 kt \u2014 blowing the exposed faces out, producing onshore chop and making conditions lumpy, especially on the western/shore-facing reefs.\n- Worst case: a steady onshore ENE breeze during the morning will make the whole day choppy and closeout-prone; a strong northerly or NW wind (rare) would steepen and blow the faces out as well.\n- Weather note: small cross-seas from the ENE swell can produce confused lineups and unpredictable set intervals; currents and rips will be strong near the rocks and points.\n\nBreak-by-break details (practical, spot-specific)\n(General reminder: when the Hawaiian numbers hit 7+ on exposed reefs, only very experienced big-wave surfers and boat support should be in the water.)\n\nPipeline / Ehukai (the Pit)\n- Expectation: With strong NNW groundtrain (7.2\u20137.5 ft H assumed long-period), Pipeline will be very powerful and extremely hollow on the bigger sets. Classic heavy barrels, very fast faces, and immediate danger. The ENE component can either backdoor/backwash the inside or add small cross-chop; long-period energy will produce the deepest, most dangerous barrels around mid to higher tide.\n- Tide window: mid to higher tides generally produce full, thick barrels here \u2014 but keep in mind tidal stage and bathymetry create rapid changes; late fall low-to-mid tides can also produce the heavier, shallower barrels depending on the day.\n- Skill recommendation: only elite chargers should consider it at the peak. Shore crew and spotters required.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Expectation: Sunset will be big, fast and long \u2014 if the NNW periods are long, expect long, powerful walls that can be ridden deeper and for longer than Pipeline. Sets will be large and could run many sections; winds and the ENE overlay will determine surface quality. Sunset often handles the biggest swell better than Pipeline in the sense of ride length, but it\u2019s still serious.\n- Key points: look for long, open faces on the right-hand walls; be wary of sets that close out in the shallow inside. Currents along the inside can be fierce.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Expectation: Big NNW energy will put Waimea into heavy big-wave mode. Expect massive outside sets and a treacherous paddle zone. Shorebreak and hold-down potential extremely high when Nc.7+ Hawaiian energy arrives.\n- Safety: Only tow-in / top-tier paddle athletes with rescue teams. Keep spectators well back; shorebreak and currents are dangerous.\n\nHaleiwa / Haleiwa Ali\u02bbi / River Mouth and Laniakea stretch\n- Expectation: Haleiwa will see strong, organized lines on the outside at moderate-high tide; with the ENE overlay, inside peaks can get messy. The larger NNW pulses will favor the outer reef breaks; inside sandbars may see confusing, punchy sets and strong current.\n- For intermediates: there will be smaller windows at sheltered spots if the trade winds stay light in the early AM.\n\nChun\u2019s / Pua\u2018ena / Kammys / Pua\u2018ena Point\n- Expectation: These exposed points will have good lines on the NNW groundtrain. Pua\u2018ena and Chun\u2019s will see fast, hollow sections \u2014 better for experienced surfers. With ENE energy, some inside rights can get filled in and become rideable but confused.\n- Smaller inside points will be less receptive to the long NNW trains and more affected by the ENE component and local wind.\n\nSmall, sheltered beaches and summer spots (e.g., Some west-facing sandbars)\n- Expectation: These will be bumped by the ENE/E component and short-period leftovers, but the long-period NNW energy won\u2019t fully energize sheltered south-to-east facing beaches. Safer options for intermediate surfers are likely to be small protected inside breaks early in the morning before trades pick up.\n\nSkill-level guidance and safety\n- Beginner: Avoid exposed reefs on all three days. Look for small, protected inside spots with minimal cross-seas and light morning wind. When the NNW exceeds ~4\u20135 ft H combined with ENE overlay, conditions become hazardous.\n- Intermediate: Pick sheltered/restricted-entrance spots in the morning. If you are not comfortable with strong currents, paddle-outs through heavy shorebreak, and steep drop-ins, sit this one out on Oct 5 peak.\n- Advanced/Expert: Oct 5 is the day for experienced chargers if the periods are long \u2014 expect fast, hollow, world-class waves. Always have support and a solid exit plan.\n- All: respect rip currents, unpredictable set intervals, and strong shorebreak. Use a leash appropriate for conditions and consider helmet/impact protection for heavy reef.\n\nWhat changes the forecast \u2014 key sensitivities\n- If the NNW pulses are short-period (<10 s): the energy will be punchy and closeout-prone. Expect heavier shorebreak, shorter interval sets, and less \u201clined up\u201d barrels. The big Hawaiian numbers will still translate to dangerous conditions, but the character shifts from hollow, spaced barrels to powerful, bumpy shorebreak.\n- If the ENE component strengthens and the trades are strong early in the day: expect the entire face to be blown out and a messy, confused sea \u2014 cleaner only in early morning calm windows, if any.\n- If wind instead trends offshore (N\u2013NW): brief clean windows will occur even at the peak, offering the best barrel opportunities at Pipeline and Sunset.\n\nComparison to recent and seasonal normal (early October)\n- Recent: if the North Shore has been mostly quiet or in the 2\u20134 ft H range through late September, this represents a step-up. The two ~7 ft H NNW pulses are notably larger than typical early-season swells for early October.\n- Seasonal normal (Fall): Typical fall pattern for the North Shore is NW to WNW energy in the 2\u20136+ ft H range, transitioning toward the consistent winter groundtrain. This forecast \u2014 multiple 7+ ft H NNW pulses \u2014 is above the typical early-fall norm and looks more like an early-season big-swell/transition to winter sequence. In short: larger than average for early October and a preview of winter-style, northwesterly energy.\n\nBottom line action items\n- If you are not surf-savvy or not equipped for big reef, avoid exposed North Shore reefs on Oct 5 (peak). Use sheltered spots and early-morning hours only.\n- Big-wave crew: check surf cams for period confirmation. If periods 12\u201316+ s, prepare for full big-wave protocols (rescue team, boards, tow if applicable).\n- Everyone: re-check live swell periods and wind forecasts before heading out. The period field is the single most important missing datum in the current input and will change the tactical choices dramatically.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Re-run this as a tighter hourly forecast for each day if you provide the missing swell periods and an accurate wind forecast.\n- Translate Hawaiian heights to estimated face heights at specific breaks if you tell me which breaks you want conversions for and confirm typical local swell-period relationships.",
  "south_shore": "Sorry\u2014I can\u2019t write in Pat Caldwell\u2019s exact voice. I can, however, give you a detailed, technical South Shore forecast that captures the same concise, data-focused, surfer-oriented approach: clear Hawaiian-size reporting, swell vector/period analysis, wind/tide effects, timing, and break-specific notes.\n\nSummary (Oct 4 \u2192 Oct 6, 2025)\n- Primary energy: SSW and SSE energy in the 2.6\u20133.0 ft (Hawaiian) range. Overall effect: moderate for the South Shore \u2014 good for longboards and mid-lengths, playable on shortboards in the better reef pockets if period and wind cooperate.\n- Wind (current report): 060\u00b0 at 0 kt (calm). Morning conditions should be light/variable; typical fall pattern can bring light NE trades afternoons \u2014 watch forecasts for any shift.\n- Tide: Check local tide tables for exact high/low times. On Town breaks (Waikiki/Ala Moana) mid to high tides usually smooth and rideable for longboarders; low tide can push into shorebreak at some reef pockets.\n\nSwell details and practical interpretation\n- Reported swells:\n  - SSW 3.0 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate influence on the South Shore.\n  - SSE 2.6 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate influence as well.\n- Hawaiian-to-face conversion: Hawaiian scale \u2248 half the face. Rough rule: face \u2248 Hawaiian \u00d7 2. So expect faces on the order of ~5\u20136 ft on the better sets where both components combine and refract over reefs.\n- Missing period data: the period values provided are 0.0 s (not available). Period is the single most important factor for usable energy. Two practical scenarios:\n  - Short-period (<8 s): energy is wind-chopty, weak push through reefs, shorter rides, more shorebreak \u2014 surfable but soft and punchy; longboards fare best.\n  - Moderate-period (8\u201312 s): best-case for this setup. Reefs will organize the lines, creating longer shoulders and more open-face sections \u2014 mid-lengths/shortboards will find usable waves.\n  - Longer-period (>12 s): unlikely for late-season local SSE/SSW but would produce stronger, more organized sets and better peaks.\n\nSwell direction and angle effects\n- SSW (\u2248 200\u2013220\u00b0) and SSE (\u2248 160\u2013170\u00b0) energy both favor the South Shore. SSW tends to light up the Diamond Head to Waikiki reef line and also refracts into Ala Moana bowls. SSE fills in the more easterly-oriented pocket reefs and can push energy into Kewalos and easterly-facing points.\n- Interference/overlap: two southerly components close in direction will either add constructively where their arrival angles align or create a bit of cross-interval confusion where angles differ. Expect the best, most organized sets where the SSW energy refracts and lines up with SSE arrivals over the reef contours.\n\nTiming (building / peaking / dropping)\n- Oct 4 (Day 1) \u2014 Present state: Both swells are in the water at moderate size (2.6\u20133.0 ft Hawaiian). With calm winds reported, mornings should be the cleanest. Expect surf to be steady through the day \u2014 usable for longboards and mid-lengths. If periods are on the longer side, you\u2019ll see more waist-to-head-high faces on sets.\n- Oct 5 (Day 2) \u2014 Peak probability: The SSW component (3.0 ft) should be at or near its best influence, particularly on SSW-favored breaks. Playability increases if the swell period is in the 8\u201312 s range. Midday into afternoon: watch for trade winds to develop (typical fall tendency), which could add surface texture.\n- Oct 6 (Day 3) \u2014 Decline: Expect a gradual drop as the southern energy eases; sets become less frequent and more nuggety. If winds remain light, mornings will still be rideable but by afternoon the surf moves down into the smaller end of the Hawaiian seasonal range.\n\nWind and weather effects specific to the South Shore\n- Current: calm (0 kt) from 060\u00b0. Calm mornings = clean conditions on the South Shore (especially Waikiki/Queens/Canoes). Light E-NE trades (if they develop later in the day) will be onshore for many South Shore spots and add chop/texture; they won\u2019t usually kill a southerly ground swell but will soften faces and shorten rides.\n- Typical fall pattern: the southern swell season tapers; trade winds can be light to moderate. Watch for localized seabreeze or building trades in afternoons which usually bring onshore texture for Waikiki and Ala Moana.\n- Weather note: with small-to-moderate southern energy, the best sessions are generally early when winds are light and tide is favorable.\n\nBreak-specific notes (Town / Waikiki / Ala Moana and other notable South Shore pockets)\n- Waikiki (Canoes, Queens, Duke\u2019s area)\n  - What to expect: Long, rideable lines when swell organizes \u2014 Canoes and Queens favor longer-period energy but still work with moderate-period SSW/SSE. With 3.0/2.6 ft Hawaiian combined you can expect fun longboard runs, occasional open faces for cutbacks.\n  - Best setup: Mid-tide to high-tide mornings with calm winds. Shortboarders will find sections around Queens if the period is 8\u201312+ s; otherwise stick to longboards/mid-lengths.\n- Ala Moana / Ala Moana Bowls\n  - What to expect: Ala Moana refracts southern energy into the bowls \u2014 when SSW hits the reef line cleanly you get punchy, hollow rights and lefts in the bowl areas, but these features are tide-sensitive.\n  - Best setup: Higher tides and lighter winds (calmer mornings). On lower tides the inside channels can get messy. The SSE component helps fill in left points that face more easterly.\n- Kewalos / Kaimana / Rocky Point area\n  - What to expect: Kewalos and adjacent reefs can see more direct SSE energy and will show punchier peaks vs. the longboard-friendly Waikiki lineup. Good for shortboards on the better sets if period is moderate.\n  - Safety: Local currents and channel effects around Kewalos can be strong on sets; pick your entry points and sit smart.\n- Other town pockets (Sans Souci, Point East of Diamond Head)\n  - What to expect: Small-to-moderate rideable waves for longboards and fun-sized shortboard sessions in the punchier pockets. Diamond Head\u2019s shadowing may reduce raw size slightly on more easterly SSE arrivals but SSW can wrap into the Head\u2019s lee and create quality peelers.\n- Overall equipment guidance: Longboards and mid-lengths are the go-to for most sessions this period. Shortboards will work selectively on reef pockets and during the better-set intervals \u2014 needs at least mid-range period to be fun.\n\nComparison to recent and normal conditions for this time of year\n- Normal for early October (late South season): South to SSW swells typically 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian with decreasing frequency as fall progresses \u2014 exactly the seasonal tail-off. Typical conditions favor longboard-friendly surf with fewer powerful South Pacific groundswell pulses.\n- Where this forecast sits: The current SSW 3.0 ft / SSE 2.6 ft (Hawaiian) setup is within the higher end of the normal range for late-season south swells \u2014 a modestly above-average push for small South Shore points and reefs. Not a major southern pulse, but a solid, surfable run of days that beats flat conditions and is better than much of what you\u2019ll see late in the season.\n- Recent trend context: If the last few days were flat or small, these arrivals will feel like a welcome uptick. If recent days already had south energy, expect small-to-moderate continuity rather than a big new pulse.\n\nSafety and surfcraft tips\n- Set expectations: \u201c3 ft Hawaiian\u201d can translate to 5\u20136 ft faces on reef peaks \u2014 treat accordingly. Be conservative about where you sit if you\u2019re not comfortable in current/reef conditions.\n- SNR: Watch for stronger currents and channel flows near Ala Moana and Diamond Head channels as sets pass; use reef channels for exits/entries where available.\n- Skill-level guidance: Beginners and longboarders will have the most consistent sessions. Intermediate shortboarders: pick pockets and priority peaks with at least mid-period swell; advanced surfers can hunt for cleaner, more powerful lefts/rights in the reef bowls at higher tide.\n\nQuick daily bullet recap\n- Oct 4: Solid, clean mornings. SSW & SSE present; longboards and mid-lengths best. Check tide \u2014 mid-high tide preferred.\n- Oct 5: Likely marginal peak of this run (SSW influence more pronounced). Good windows if winds stay light; watch for afternoon trades.\n- Oct 6: Gradual drop. Still rideable early; sets thin out and sessions become more intermittent.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull in hourly surf buoys and specific tide times for Waikiki/Ala Moana to add precision to the timing.\n- Re-run the forecast assuming two period scenarios (short vs. mid-period) so you can see exact expected faces and interval counts for each break.",
  "daily": "Oahu surf forecast \u2014 2025-10-04 (NNW swell)\nQuick summary: A NNW-grounded swell is the dominant energy today. Biggest exposure is the North/NW-facing reefs and points. Expect best, most powerful waves on the North Shore and Makaha; south and windward shores will be relatively small. Morning sessions most likely to be cleaner \u2014 winds tend to pick up into the afternoon.\n\n1) Current conditions (today)\n- Primary energy: NNW swell\u2014long-period, favors north\u2011to\u2011northwest exposures.\n- Overall surf: Bigger and powerful on the North Shore and west side; small and more playful on the south shore.\n- Use caution on reef breaks \u2014 hollow, fast sections and shallow reef can be hazardous on incoming energy.\n\n2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale) \u2014 with rough face-height conversion (Hawaiian \u00d72 \u2248 face height)\n- North Shore (Pipeline / Sunset / Haleiwa zone): 5\u20137 ft Hawaiian (10\u201314 ft face) at exposed reef peaks \u2014 big, powerful, for experienced locals only. Some beaches/outer points in Haleiwa may be smaller (3\u20135 ft Hawaiian).\n- West Shore (Makaha / Pokai): 3\u20135 ft Hawaiian (6\u201310 ft face) \u2014 good solid wraps on NW/N waves if winds allow.\n- South Shore (Waikiki / Ala Moana): 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian (2\u20136 ft face) \u2014 fun, rideable for most skill levels, especially morning.\n- East/Windward: 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (2\u20134 ft face) \u2014 generally small; wind direction can influence size.\n\n3) Wind & weather\n- Typical pattern today: light variable to N/NNE in the early morning (best window), with trade winds (NE) building into the late morning/afternoon (10\u201318+ kt) \u2014 expect chop and blown-out faces on north-facing spots in the afternoon.\n- If winds stay more NNW, north shore will be bumpier; if they shift NE, conditions get onshore for north shore and cleaner for parts of the west shore.\n- Always check the local wind forecast before heading out.\n\n4) Tide info relevant to surfing\n- Reef breaks (Pipeline, Sunset) perform best on mid- to higher-tides; very low tide exposes sharp coral and reduces safe takeoff zones.\n- Beach breaks (Waikiki, Haleiwa town beaches) are more forgiving across tides but can close out on very high tide.\n- Actionable: aim to surf North Shore reefs around mid-tide for better shaping and reduced shallow hazard. Check today\u2019s local tide chart (Haleiwa/Barbers/Ka\u2019ena tide times) before you go.\n\n5) Best spots for today (actionable picks)\n- If you want big, hollow, expert waves: Ehukai (Pipeline) and Sunset \u2014 only for experienced local chargers with knowledge of currents and crowd dynamics.\n- If you want long, more manageable lines on the north side: Haleiwa (First/Second) \u2014 pick your lineup based on size (First breaks earlier, Second gets more shortboard action).\n- If you want a solid alternative with cleaner lines (wind permitting): Makaha \u2014 good for strong NW/N swells, check local wind.\n- If you want an easy, safer session or longboard/funboard rides: Waikiki / Canoes \u2014 small but consistent on this swell.\n- Beginners/less confident surfers: stick to protected south shore spots with lifeguards on duty, or skip if conditions look big or the shore is crowded.\n\n6) Changing conditions through the day\n- Best window: early morning (before trades pick up) \u2014 cleaner faces, better offshore/offshore-leaning winds for some spots.\n- Mid-to-late morning and afternoon: trade winds typically increase \u2192 more onshore chop on North Shore; winds may clean up west-facing breaks if they stay more northerly/offshore.\n- Swell energy can peak early or mid-day depending on the swell\u2019s arrival; check local buoy/cam updates and tide timing.\n\nSafety reminders\n- Reef hazards: know the takeoff zone and exit spots; wear booties if you don\u2019t know the bottom.\n- If unsure, check live cams, NOAA marine advisories, and talk to local lifeguards or shop/frontline locals before paddling out.\n- Respect size: if you\u2019re not comfortable in the reported Hawaiian ranges, pick a smaller, protected spot.\n\nNote: This is a forecast based on an NNW swell pattern. Always confirm local real-time conditions (cams, wind/tide charts, lifeguards) before heading out.",
