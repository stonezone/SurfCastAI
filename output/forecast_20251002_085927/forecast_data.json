  "main_forecast": "I\u2019m ready to tighten it up, but I don\u2019t have the forecast content yet. Please paste the forecast text (or attach it) and I\u2019ll revise it while preserving your voice and core information.\n\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s a tightened, ready-to-fill template that keeps your style and ensures technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness. You can copy this structure and just fill in the data you have.\n\nRegion and timeframe\n- Region \u2014 Timeframe (e.g., \u201cNorth Shore, Oahu \u2014 Thu AM to Sat PM\u201d)\n\nSwell setup\n- Primary swell: height (ft or m), direction, period (s)\n- Secondary swell (if present): height, direction, period (s)\n- Notes on dominance: which swell is driving size at which times, and how the secondary swell modifies texture (e.g., bumpier mornings, cleaner late afternoons)\n\nWind forecast\n- Direction, speed (and gusts), offshore/onshore trend by time\n- Specifically note wind shifts: e.g., \u201clight offshore morning, turning onshore mid-morning, easing evening\u201d\n- Any notable wind interactions with particular breaks (e.g., cross-shore winds affecting pockets)\n\nTide considerations (optional but helpful)\n- Major tides and their expected impact on key breaks\n- Best tide windows for exposure or protection against strong tides\n\nWeather and precip notes\n- Showers, cloud cover, humidity effects on visibility and surface texture\n- Any marine layer or frontal influences\n\nConfidence/uncertainty\n- Brief note on forecast confidence (optional)\n\nShore-by-shore highlights\nFor each shore or area you cover (repeat as needed):\n\n- Shore name or area\n- Conditions window: best windows (e.g., \u201cbest at dawn and late afternoon,\u201d or \u201clate morning through early afternoon\u201d)\n- Expected surf: height and period ranges, and which swell dominates\n  - Example: \u201cPrimary swell 3\u20135 ft @ 12\u201315 s from the NE; secondary 2\u20133 ft @ 14\u201316 s from ENE\u201d\n- Wind/tide interplay: how wind and tides will affect the break\n  - Include specific times for wind shifts if relevant\n- Exposure notes: which breaks are exposed to the swell direction\n  - Mention if some breaks tighten up or hold better with certain wind directions\n- Hazards or advisories: rips, rocks, crowding, reef exposure\n- Practical guidance: best windows by hour, and any spots to avoid due to conditions or crowds\n\nConsistency checks to run while drafting\n- Units: keep height in feet or meters consistently; keep period in seconds\n- Swell consistency: ensure primary vs. secondary swell are clearly labeled and dominance is stated for overlapping times\n- Direction alignment: match swell direction to shore exposure (NE swell -> east-facing breaks, SW swell -> south-facing breaks, etc.) and note any overrides where a shore behaves differently\n- Timings: clearly state wind shifts and any tide-influenced windows; avoid conflicting statements like \u201coffshore all day\u201d with \u201conshore developing by mid-morning\u201d\n- Clarity: use parallel structure for similar lines (e.g., \u201cPrimary swell: X\u2013Y ft @ Z\u2013W s from NE. Secondary swell: A\u2013B ft @ C\u2013D s from ENE.\u201d)\n\nWhat I\u2019ll deliver when you share the forecast\n- A tightened, consistency-checked version in your exact voice\n- Clear timing for wind shifts and best window hours\n- Shore-by-shore details with precise ranges and exposure notes\n- No data added beyond what you provide; I\u2019ll keep everything aligned with your sources\n\nIf you\u2019re ready now, paste:\n- Region(s) covered\n- Timeframe (dates/times)\n- Preferred units (ft/m, seconds)\n- Any shores you want emphasized or de-emphasized\n\nI\u2019ll produce a polished, ready-to-publish forecast that preserves your style and core information.",
