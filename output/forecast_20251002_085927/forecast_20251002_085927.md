## Main Forecast

I’m ready to tighten it up, but I don’t have the forecast content yet. Please paste the forecast text (or attach it) and I’ll revise it while preserving your voice and core information.

In the meantime, here’s a tightened, ready-to-fill template that keeps your style and ensures technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness. You can copy this structure and just fill in the data you have.

Region and timeframe
- Region — Timeframe (e.g., “North Shore, Oahu — Thu AM to Sat PM”)

Swell setup
- Primary swell: height (ft or m), direction, period (s)
- Secondary swell (if present): height, direction, period (s)
- Notes on dominance: which swell is driving size at which times, and how the secondary swell modifies texture (e.g., bumpier mornings, cleaner late afternoons)

Wind forecast
- Direction, speed (and gusts), offshore/onshore trend by time
- Specifically note wind shifts: e.g., “light offshore morning, turning onshore mid-morning, easing evening”
- Any notable wind interactions with particular breaks (e.g., cross-shore winds affecting pockets)

Tide considerations (optional but helpful)
- Major tides and their expected impact on key breaks
- Best tide windows for exposure or protection against strong tides

Weather and precip notes
- Showers, cloud cover, humidity effects on visibility and surface texture
- Any marine layer or frontal influences

Confidence/uncertainty
- Brief note on forecast confidence (optional)

Shore-by-shore highlights
For each shore or area you cover (repeat as needed):

- Shore name or area
- Conditions window: best windows (e.g., “best at dawn and late afternoon,” or “late morning through early afternoon”)
- Expected surf: height and period ranges, and which swell dominates
  - Example: “Primary swell **3–5 ft** @ **12–15 s** from the NE; secondary **2–3 ft** @ **14–16 s** from ENE”
- Wind/tide interplay: how wind and tides will affect the break
  - Include specific times for wind shifts if relevant
- Exposure notes: which breaks are exposed to the swell direction
  - Mention if some breaks tighten up or hold better with certain wind directions
- Hazards or advisories: rips, rocks, crowding, reef exposure
- Practical guidance: best windows by hour, and any spots to avoid due to conditions or crowds

Consistency checks to run while drafting
- Units: keep height in feet or meters consistently; keep period in seconds
- Swell consistency: ensure primary vs. secondary swell are clearly labeled and dominance is stated for overlapping times
- Direction alignment: match swell direction to shore exposure (NE swell -> east-facing breaks, SW swell -> south-facing breaks, etc.) and note any overrides where a shore behaves differently
- Timings: clearly state wind shifts and any tide-influenced windows; avoid conflicting statements like “offshore all day” with “onshore developing by mid-morning”
- Clarity: use parallel structure for similar lines (e.g., “Primary swell: X–Y ft @ Z–W s from NE. Secondary swell: A–B ft @ C–D s from ENE.”)

What I’ll deliver when you share the forecast
- A tightened, consistency-checked version in your exact voice
- Clear timing for wind shifts and best window hours
- Shore-by-shore details with precise ranges and exposure notes
- No data added beyond what you provide; I’ll keep everything aligned with your sources

If you’re ready now, paste:
- Region(s) covered
- Timeframe (dates/times)
- Preferred units (ft/m, seconds)
- Any shores you want emphasized or de-emphasized

I’ll produce a polished, ready-to-publish forecast that preserves your style and core information.
