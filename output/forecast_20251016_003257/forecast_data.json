Physics\u2011based arrivals show a 6 ft @ 18 s pulse at 04:10 HST plus several 5 ft @ 13\u201314 s pulses later that day \u2014 these will be the primary swell drivers for North/NW exposures.\n- Short\u2011term: residual SW energy seen in offshore buoys is fading through Oct 16 and will have minor impact on south\u2011facing breaks.\n- Winds: NE trades in place (PHNL METAR 07008KT at 00:53 HST) with a subtropical high east of Hawaii expected to reinforce trades into the 15\u201325 kt range in exposed spots \u2014 expect wind chop/east\u2011side onshore texture, especially afternoons.\n- Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0 overall; data quality ~0.68 (missing model and nearshore buoy feeds increases timing/height uncertainty).\n\nDETAILS\n- NW/NNW long\u2011period energy \u2014 source & timing: Sea\u2011state analyses and pressure charts show a deep Gulf Alaska storm (\u2248971 mb near 44N/150W) generating long fetch and 16\u201320 s energy aimed southeast. Physics propagation predicts organized arrivals to start 10/18 (primary 6 ft @18 s at 04:10 HST), with multiple 5 ft @13\u201314 s pulses through the day (arrivals 01:41\u201320:22 HST depending on source). These are the highest\u2011confidence swell arrivals for this window (watch NDBC 460xx for source verification and HI buoys 51001/51002 for arrival).\n- Mid\u2011period NW component: A central\u2011Pacific gale near 170W (\u2248996 mb) should contribute 12\u201315 s energy arriving ~3\u20135 days after generation; this will augment the northwest sector energy already expected on 10/18.\n- Residual SW: Matrix shows a high SW sea\u2011state (214\u00b0 at 13 s) in offshore buoy data on 10/15\u201316. Nearshore exposure and refraction will reduce its impact \u2014 expect it to fade through 10/16 and be a minor contributor to south faces.\n- Wind & local chops: Subtropical high east of the islands will reinforce NE trades. Expect local winds to be the primary determinant of surf quality on exposed reef and point breaks. METAR currently light NE (~8 kt) but model\u2011derived pressure gradients indicate a trend toward stronger trades in exposed areas (15\u201325 kt potential). Missing model/upper\u2011air feeds increase uncertainty in exact timing of strengthening.\n\nNORTH SHORE (O\u02bbahu)\n- What to expect: NW/NNW groundswell building through Fri 10/17 and peaking early\u2013late Sat 10/18 with long periods (13\u201318 s). Primary risk: problematic cross\u2011sea and strong currents as multiple pulses stack. Deep\u2011water buoys show large offshore H1/3 energy (matrix values high), but nearshore Hawaiian\u2011scale H1/3 will be lower; use the physics arrivals as nearshore guidance.\n- Estimated local surf: Saturday 10/18 likely to see significant sets \u2014 expect H1/3 on exposed points in the higher end of intermediate to large (multiple 4\u20138 ft H1/3 possible from combined pulses), with H1/10 set faces larger. Exact local faces depend on refracting bathymetry; monitor buoy 51002 and local spot cameras. Confidence: medium (0.6\u20130.75) \u2014 timing and peak height sensitive to storm evolution and ridge refracting.\n- Winds/tides: Mornings likely cleaner before trades build; afternoon onshore NE winds and chop degrade quality. Tidal range small; current/shorebreak risks increase on rising swell. Data gap: no nearshore buoy timeseries \u2014 take local observations early.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- What to expect: The SW component evident offshore is decaying; south swell energy will be minimal to small for the period 10/16\u201310/18. Primary surf drivers will be the incoming NW energy that refracts into some southern and west\u2011facing coves but most south beaches will be flat to knee\u2011chest on sets.\n- Recommended spots: For small SW/SS surf look to protected beach breaks (Waikiki/White Plains) early 10/16; expect decreased size thereafter. Trades will introduce chop on east\u2011facing shores; small high\u2011tide shorebreaks possible where local bathymetry focuses the fading SW energy.\n- Confidence: below average for south swell persistence \u2014 the large SW H1/3 in offshore buoys is likely deep\u2011water energy that will not translate fully into protected southern shallow spots.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 10/18)\n- Short term (10/19\u201310/20): Expect lingering NW energy with a probable drop after the 10/18 pulse(s). Smaller 13\u201315 s arrivals from secondary Aleutian/Gulf sources may keep surf elevated through 10/19.\n- Medium term (10/20\u201310/22): Pressure chart analysis flags the deep 971 mb Gulf Alaska storm and associated frontal band as a potential source of a larger, longer\u2011period (16\u201320 s) swell in the 4\u20136 day range from chart epoch \u2014 this could re\u2011energize the North Shore with more solid long\u2011period sets later in the week. Monitor model runs and buoy 460xx time\u2011series; missing model feeds right now increase arrival timing uncertainty.\n- Tropical: Central Pacific tropical outlook is quiet for the next 7 days \u2014 no tropical contributions expected.\n- Buoy/watch list: NDBC 51001 / 51002 (Hawaii coastal), NDBC 460xx (NW Pacific storm track), local webcams and NOAA nearshore forecasts. With missing nearshore buoy and model feeds in this digest, real\u2011time buoy traces will be decisive for final height/timing.\n\nNotes & caveats\n- Many matrix H1/3 values quoted are offshore/deep\u2011water sea\u2011state numbers; local Hawaiian\u2011scale surf (H1/3 and H1/10) will be modified by bathymetry/refraction and can be lower or higher at focal points. H1/10 estimates in the matrix use conversion factors (\u22481.3\u00d7 H1/3) \u2014 treat them as first\u2011order set face estimates.\n- Data gaps: altimetry, model runs, nearshore buoy time series, and satellite feeds were not available in this digest \u2014 these increase timing and exact peak height uncertainty. Use the buoy list above and local observations for updates.\n- Overall forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0.\n\nPat \"SwellCaldWell\" Caldwell \u2014 Surf News Network\nCharts valid 06/00 UTC 16 Oct 2025.

  "north_shore": "Dominant energy for the North Shore through this window is a strong N\u2011to\u2011NNW ground\u2011swell \u2014 buoy data show roughly 15\u201316 ft H1/3 at ~15 s (roughly 20\u201321 ft H1/10 equivalent) arriving in the 2025\u201110\u201115 23:50 HST window and dominating Oct 16\u201317. Expect the usual fall track: long\u2011period NNW energy lighting up the reefs now, with additional Gulf Alaska / Aleutian pulses forecast to begin arriving late Saturday (Oct 18) that will refresh NW/WNW energy and likely push heights higher on exposed breaks.\n\nWind / tide interplay (short and to the point)\n- Observed winds are light ENE (070\u00b0) ~8 kt \u2014 this is generally favorable for the North Shore reef line (light ENE is typically cross\u2011offshore to offshore at Pipeline/Ehukai and Sunset), so expect cleaner faces through the morning hours.  \n- Afternoon thermal onshores are possible; if winds back into the ESE\u2013SE and pick up, expect surface chop and blown\u2011out lips on the more exposed reefs. Best windows for clean lines will be early AM.  \n- Tides are low in the evenings right now; many North Shore reefs change character with tide \u2014 shallow reef sections will punch harder on mid to falling tides and can become stomping shorebreaks at very low water. Time sets accordingly.\n\nFlagship break guidance\n- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai)\n  - Expect heavy, hollow, powerful tubes \u2014 live faces in the 20\u201325 ft range on prime sets with the 15 s NNW energy (H1/10 ~20\u201321 ft supports very large reef faces).  \n  - Best chances for clean, surfable barrels are early morning with current light ENE winds. Very technical \u2014 only for experienced local tow or elite shortboarders on large days. Confidence: high for direction/size (exposure weight 0.93), moderate for exact face/runability due to missing model/altimetry feeds.\n- Sunset Beach\n  - Long, powerful sections from the NNW/NW; expect long, fast rides and heavy closeouts on the biggest sets. Faces commonly in the high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s on the peak sets; WNW energy (smaller) will add push and make Sunset more stage\u2011like late in the period. Best early AM, beware shifting peaks and strong currents. Confidence: moderate\u2011high.\n- Waimea Bay\n  - This is big\u2011wave country given this energy \u2014 expect very large, fast faces (operational big\u2011wave conditions for tow teams). Surf will be raw and infrequent but massive; timing and rideability depend a lot on local bathymetry and the late Saturday pulses. Not safe for swimmers or standard paddle surfing. Confidence: moderate.\n- Quick notes on backups: Off\u2011angle WNW energy (smaller ~7 ft @13s) will favor Sunset and some west\u2011facing points more than Pipeline; small WNW component can fill inside channels and change closeout patterns.\n\nHazards\n- These observed/forecast heights are at or above typical North Shore high\u2011surf advisory thresholds \u2014 expect extremely hazardous surf, life\u2011threatening rip currents, strong shorebreaks and wash\u2011throughs, and dangerous shoreline impacts. Waimea and Pipeline conditions will be hazardous to everyone but the most experienced, with heavy consequences for wipeouts. If you\u2019re not trained and equipped for big\u2011wave conditions, stay off the water and away from exposed shorelines. (High Surf Advisory thresholds commonly trigger near the 15 ft H1/3 level \u2014 these buoys exceed that.)\n\nConfidence & data caveats\n- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence 0.68 / 1.00; local quality index ~0.55). Buoy coverage is strong (14/17 successful, and the largest swells are buoy\u2011observed with high exposure weights ~0.93), which gives solid direction/size information. However, model and altimetry feeds are missing and nearshore buoy/satellite coverage is incomplete \u2014 that raises uncertainty on exact peak face heights, timing of the late Saturday pulses, and wind evolution onshore afternoons. I\u2019m confident about the presence of very large NNW energy and general trends; confidence drops to moderate for precise break\u2011by\u2011break face estimates and timing of the Saturday reinforcement.\n\nBottom line\n- Expect very large, powerful NNW surf across the North Shore Oct 16\u201317 with the cleanest conditions in the early morning while winds remain light ENE. Additional NW/WNW pulses are likely late Saturday (Oct 18) and could further elevate risk and size. Use extreme caution \u2014 these conditions exceed high\u2011surf advisory thresholds and are only for experienced big\u2011wave crews.",
  "south_shore": "Caldwell-style South Shore forecast \u2014 2025-10-16 \u2192 2025-10-18\n\nSummary (quick take)\n- Primary driver: a SW pulse (13 s) that registered strongly on offshore buoys; geometry gives moderate wrap onto the South Shore. Expect the biggest energy on the 16th with a steady decay through the 17th\u201318th. Background Southern Hemi activity is low for this time of year, so nothing new to prop the south side up after the initial pulse.\n- Size (best-estimate, surf scale = Hawaiian): Oct 16 \u2014 2\u20134 ft (H1/3) with occasional 3\u20136 ft H1/10 sets at the most exposed reef windows. Oct 17 \u2014 1.5\u20133 ft (H1/3), H1/10 to ~2.5\u20134 ft. Oct 18 \u2014 1\u20132.5 ft (H1/3), H1/10 to ~2\u20133.5 ft. Expect variability by exposure; exposed outside reefs will see the upper end of these ranges.\n- Confidence: medium (0.68/1). Buoy and tide/port data solid; missing altimetry, nearshore buoys and model feeds increase uncertainty in exact nearshore decay and local wrap angles.\n\nOpening assessment \u2014 size, direction, timing\n- The strongest measured energy in the data set is a SW 13 s pulse (deepwater H1/3 \u2248 16.4 ft). That deepwater number is large but highly reduced by propagation, island blocking and local exposure \u2014 the South Shore will not see that number inshore. With the recorded SW vector and an exposure weight ~0.50, the practical nearshore outcome is a moderate southerly swell energy burst arriving 16\u201324 hrs after the buoy observation window and peaking on Oct 16. Peak periods near the coast will be ~11\u201313 s from the SW\u2013SSW quadrant with sets most consistent during the day on Oct 16, then tapering through the 17th and into the 18th.\n- Background Southern Hemi pulses are weak for this period (climatology and available buoy data), so after this SW burst subsidence is expected rather than reinforcement.\n\nWrap potential and swell interaction\n- Geometry: the SW source has a good bearing to wrap into southeast-facing windows (Diamond Head and parts of Waikiki) \u2014 expect punchier, longer-period sets at outside reefs where the angle is more favorable. Town-facing reefs (Ala Moana, mid-Waikiki) see a softer, more refracted version of the same pulse.\n- Cross-swell/confusion: by Oct 18 multiple north/NW pulses from Gulf Alaska/Aleutian fetch are forecast to arrive (see physics-based arrivals). Those will be primarily north energy; when they overlap with residual SW energy expect some confused, shorter-period lumps and onshore chop at times \u2014 not ideal for pure south-swell lines but it will create erratic peaks and increased current/rip potential.\n\nLocal winds & diurnal trends\n- Latest obs: 070\u00b0 at 8 kt (light ENE/ENE-ish). Light ENE trades are generally favorable for the South Shore \u2014 they tend to be cross-shore to slightly offshore at many south-facing breaks early day, delivering cleaner faces.\n- Expect mornings to be the cleanest each day while winds remain light. Sea-breeze tendencies can push winds more SSE\u2013S in the afternoon, increasing texture and onshore component on the 16th\u201318th. Monitor local radar/obs; a switch to S\u2013SSE would dull the lines and favor short, punchy sets over long, clean walls.\n\nTown reefs vs. outlier breaks \u2014 specifics\n- Waikiki (Queens / Canoes)\n  - Oct 16: Rideable, more consistent on the outer points. Period ~12\u201313 s will open up longer runners at Canoes; sets will be chest\u2013shoulder for longboards and small shortboards. Expect the best windows in the calm morning.\n  - Oct 17\u201318: Softer; Canoes/Queens become more longboard-friendly with fewer long runners. Crowd mild to moderate; locals will show up for glassy conditions.\n- Ala Moana Bowl\n  - Typically a fatter, more wind-affected break. On the 16th expect occasional punchy bowls on larger sets but overall it will prefer the lower end of the pulse \u2014 better for longboarders and cruising logs. Mid to high tide windows will fill in best.\n- Diamond Head / outside reefs\n  - Picks up the most direct energy and wrap. On Oct 16 expect the cleanest, most powerful peaks here \u2014 shoulder to occasional head-high faces for experienced shortboarders where the period remains 11\u201313 s. Diamond Head performs best on mid to incoming tide; expect the best quality in the morning to early afternoon before any sea-breeze builds.\n- Outliers (east-facing points and reef windows)\n  - Where the angle allows, expect punchy, fast walls that will favor shortboards; however these will be inconsistent and will come in sets separated by longer lulls.\n\nLongboard vs. shortboard suitability and crowd/consistency\n- Oct 16: Mixed conditions. Longboarders will find reliable lines at Waikiki/Canoes and Ala Moana on the smaller, refracted energy; shortboarders should target Diamond Head/outside peaks at the peaks of the sets. Expect intermittent high-quality sets rather than steady overhead surf.\n- Oct 17\u201318: Best for longboarders and funboarders as the pulse fades \u2014 more consistent small-to-medium runners. Shortboarders will see fewer clean high-performance opportunities and more lump/confused windows as NW energy begins to interfere.\n- Crowd notes: Cleaner mornings \u2192 larger crowds on the good windows. When Diamond Head lights up expect the advanced cohort to show; town beaches will remain busy on fair mornings.\n\nTides & timing\n- Recent tide obs show low to mid tidal range at night (latest obs ~1.75 ft). For South Shore reefs:\n  - Diamond Head: favors mid to high tide for shape and peel.\n  - Waikiki/Ala Moana: fills best on mid to high tide; certain runs at Canoes are best on the incoming.\n- Plan sessions for morning mid-tide windows through Oct 16\u201317 for the best combination of tide and light winds.\n\nHazards & safety\n- Increased rip currents during the decay phase and when cross/contrasting swell components overlap. The larger outside sets at Diamond Head carry stronger currents and faster closeouts \u2014 only experienced surfers should paddle out on the peak energy of Oct 16.\n- Confused seas expected by Oct 18 as north/fetch components arrive \u2014 stronger chop and erratic sets increase the risk of wipeouts.\n\nGear and strategy\n- Oct 16: Shortboard for Diamond Head/outside peaks; 5\u20198\u20136\u20193 depending on comfort. For Waikiki and Ala Moana, longboard or mini\u2011mal recommended for more catchable, smoother rides.\n- Oct 17\u201318: Logs and longboards feel best, funboards also fine. Shortboarders pick mornings for cleaner lines; afternoons likely bumpier.\n\nData confidence & caveats\n- Confidence medium (0.68/1). Buoy coverage producing the core swell signal is good; however missing altimetry, nearshore buoys, satellite imagery and model feeds reduce precision on how much deepwater energy refracts and attenuates into each local window. Treat the size ranges above as best-estimate envelopes; local variations will be significant between exposed outside reefs and sheltered town points.\n\nBottom line\n- Expect a clear SW-driven peak on Oct 16 with the best, punchiest lines at Diamond Head and rideable longboard conditions at Waikiki/Ala Moana. Energy fades through the 17th\u201318th; north arrivals late in the period will increase confusion and chop. Morning sessions look best each day while winds remain light.\n\nIf you want I can run a location-specific estimate (Ala Moana, Queens, Diamond Head) with tighter H1/3 and H1/10 nearshore conversions and recommended session windows based on the next available tide predictions.",
