<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dominant energy: long‑period NW/NNW swell building into Oahu with the first organized arrivals Saturday 2025‑10‑18. Physics‑based arrivals show a <strong>6 ft</strong> @ 18 s pulse at 04:10 HST plus several <strong>5 ft</strong> @ <strong>13–14 s</strong> pulses later that day — these will be the primary swell drivers for North/NW exposures.</li>
<li>Short‑term: residual SW energy seen in offshore buoys is fading through Oct 16 and will have minor impact on south‑facing breaks.</li>
<li>Winds: NE trades in place (PHNL METAR 07008KT at 00:53 HST) with a subtropical high east of Hawaii expected to reinforce trades into the 15–25 kt range in exposed spots — expect wind chop/east‑side onshore texture, especially afternoons.</li>
<li>Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0 overall; data quality ~0.68 (missing model and nearshore buoy feeds increases timing/height uncertainty).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>NW/NNW long‑period energy — source &amp; timing: Sea‑state analyses and pressure charts show a deep Gulf Alaska storm (≈971 mb near 44N/150W) generating long fetch and <strong>16–20 s</strong> energy aimed southeast. Physics propagation predicts organized arrivals to start 10/18 (primary <strong>6 ft</strong> @18 s at 04:10 HST), with multiple <strong>5 ft</strong> @<strong>13–14 s</strong> pulses through the day (arrivals 01:41–20:22 HST depending on source). These are the highest‑confidence swell arrivals for this window (watch NDBC 460xx for source verification and HI buoys 51001/51002 for arrival).</li>
<li>Mid‑period NW component: A central‑Pacific gale near 170W (≈996 mb) should contribute <strong>12–15 s</strong> energy arriving ~3–5 days after generation; this will augment the northwest sector energy already expected on 10/18.</li>
<li>Residual SW: Matrix shows a high SW sea‑state (214° at 13 s) in offshore buoy data on 10/15–16. Nearshore exposure and refraction will reduce its impact — expect it to fade through 10/16 and be a minor contributor to south faces.</li>
<li>Wind &amp; local chops: Subtropical high east of the islands will reinforce NE trades. Expect local winds to be the primary determinant of surf quality on exposed reef and point breaks. METAR currently light NE (~8 kt) but model‑derived pressure gradients indicate a trend toward stronger trades in exposed areas (15–25 kt potential). Missing model/upper‑air feeds increase uncertainty in exact timing of strengthening.</li>
</ul>
<p>NORTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- What to expect: NW/NNW groundswell building through Fri 10/17 and peaking early–late Sat 10/18 with long periods (<strong>13–18 s</strong>). Primary risk: problematic cross‑sea and strong currents as multiple pulses stack. Deep‑water buoys show large offshore H1/3 energy (matrix values high), but nearshore Hawaiian‑scale H1/3 will be lower; use the physics arrivals as nearshore guidance.
- Estimated local surf: Saturday 10/18 likely to see significant sets — expect H1/3 on exposed points in the higher end of intermediate to large (multiple <strong>4–8 ft</strong> H1/3 possible from combined pulses), with H1/10 set faces larger. Exact local faces depend on refracting bathymetry; monitor buoy 51002 and local spot cameras. Confidence: medium (0.6–0.75) — timing and peak height sensitive to storm evolution and ridge refracting.
- Winds/tides: Mornings likely cleaner before trades build; afternoon onshore NE winds and chop degrade quality. Tidal range small; current/shorebreak risks increase on rising swell. Data gap: no nearshore buoy timeseries — take local observations early.</p>
<h3>South Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>What to expect: The SW component evident offshore is decaying; south swell energy will be minimal to small for the period 10/16–10/18. Primary surf drivers will be the incoming NW energy that refracts into some southern and west‑facing coves but most south beaches will be flat to knee‑chest on sets.</li>
<li>Recommended spots: For small SW/SS surf look to protected beach breaks (Waikiki/White Plains) early 10/16; expect decreased size thereafter. Trades will introduce chop on east‑facing shores; small high‑tide shorebreaks possible where local bathymetry focuses the fading SW energy.</li>
<li>Confidence: below average for south swell persistence — the large SW H1/3 in offshore buoys is likely deep‑water energy that will not translate fully into protected southern shallow spots.</li>
</ul>
<p>OUTLOOK (beyond 10/18)
- Short term (10/19–10/20): Expect lingering NW energy with a probable drop after the 10/18 pulse(s). Smaller <strong>13–15 s</strong> arrivals from secondary Aleutian/Gulf sources may keep surf elevated through 10/19.
- Medium term (10/20–10/22): Pressure chart analysis flags the deep 971 mb Gulf Alaska storm and associated frontal band as a potential source of a larger, longer‑period (<strong>16–20 s</strong>) swell in the 4–6 day range from chart epoch — this could re‑energize the North Shore with more solid long‑period sets later in the week. Monitor model runs and buoy 460xx time‑series; missing model feeds right now increase arrival timing uncertainty.
- Tropical: Central Pacific tropical outlook is quiet for the next 7 days — no tropical contributions expected.
- Buoy/watch list: NDBC 51001 / 51002 (Hawaii coastal), NDBC 460xx (NW Pacific storm track), local webcams and NOAA nearshore forecasts. With missing nearshore buoy and model feeds in this digest, real‑time buoy traces will be decisive for final height/timing.</p>
<p>Notes &amp; caveats
- Many matrix H1/3 values quoted are offshore/deep‑water sea‑state numbers; local Hawaiian‑scale surf (H1/3 and H1/10) will be modified by bathymetry/refraction and can be lower or higher at focal points. H1/10 estimates in the matrix use conversion factors (≈1.3× H1/3) — treat them as first‑order set face estimates.
- Data gaps: altimetry, model runs, nearshore buoy time series, and satellite feeds were not available in this digest — these increase timing and exact peak height uncertainty. Use the buoy list above and local observations for updates.
- Overall forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0.</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Dominant energy for the North Shore through this window is a strong N‑to‑NNW ground‑swell — buoy data show roughly <strong>15–16 ft</strong> H1/3 at ~15 s (roughly <strong>20–21 ft</strong> H1/10 equivalent) arriving in the 2025‑10‑15 23:50 HST window and dominating Oct 16–17. Expect the usual fall track: long‑period NNW energy lighting up the reefs now, with additional Gulf Alaska / Aleutian pulses forecast to begin arriving late Saturday (Oct 18) that will refresh NW/WNW energy and likely push heights higher on exposed breaks.</p>
<p>Wind / tide interplay (short and to the point)
- Observed winds are light ENE (070°) ~8 kt — this is generally favorable for the North Shore reef line (light ENE is typically cross‑offshore to offshore at Pipeline/Ehukai and Sunset), so expect cleaner faces through the morning hours.<br />
- Afternoon thermal onshores are possible; if winds back into the ESE–SE and pick up, expect surface chop and blown‑out lips on the more exposed reefs. Best windows for clean lines will be early AM.<br />
- Tides are low in the evenings right now; many North Shore reefs change character with tide — shallow reef sections will punch harder on mid to falling tides and can become stomping shorebreaks at very low water. Time sets accordingly.</p>
<p>Flagship break guidance
- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai)
  - Expect heavy, hollow, powerful tubes — live faces in the <strong>20–25 ft</strong> range on prime sets with the 15 s NNW energy (H1/10 ~<strong>20–21 ft</strong> supports very large reef faces).<br />
  - Best chances for clean, surfable barrels are early morning with current light ENE winds. Very technical — only for experienced local tow or elite shortboarders on large days. Confidence: high for direction/size (exposure weight 0.93), moderate for exact face/runability due to missing model/altimetry feeds.
- Sunset Beach
  - Long, powerful sections from the NNW/NW; expect long, fast rides and heavy closeouts on the biggest sets. Faces commonly in the high‑teens to mid‑20s on the peak sets; WNW energy (smaller) will add push and make Sunset more stage‑like late in the period. Best early AM, beware shifting peaks and strong currents. Confidence: moderate‑high.
- Waimea Bay
  - This is big‑wave country given this energy — expect very large, fast faces (operational big‑wave conditions for tow teams). Surf will be raw and infrequent but massive; timing and rideability depend a lot on local bathymetry and the late Saturday pulses. Not safe for swimmers or standard paddle surfing. Confidence: moderate.
- Quick notes on backups: Off‑angle WNW energy (smaller ~<strong>7 ft</strong> @13s) will favor Sunset and some west‑facing points more than Pipeline; small WNW component can fill inside channels and change closeout patterns.</p>
<p>Hazards
- These observed/forecast heights are at or above typical North Shore high‑surf advisory thresholds — expect extremely hazardous surf, life‑threatening rip currents, strong shorebreaks and wash‑throughs, and dangerous shoreline impacts. Waimea and Pipeline conditions will be hazardous to everyone but the most experienced, with heavy consequences for wipeouts. If you’re not trained and equipped for big‑wave conditions, stay off the water and away from exposed shorelines. (High Surf Advisory thresholds commonly trigger near the <strong>15 ft</strong> H1/3 level — these buoys exceed that.)</p>
<p>Confidence &amp; data caveats
- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence 0.68 / 1.00; local quality index ~0.55). Buoy coverage is strong (14/17 successful, and the largest swells are buoy‑observed with high exposure weights ~0.93), which gives solid direction/size information. However, model and altimetry feeds are missing and nearshore buoy/satellite coverage is incomplete — that raises uncertainty on exact peak face heights, timing of the late Saturday pulses, and wind evolution onshore afternoons. I’m confident about the presence of very large NNW energy and general trends; confidence drops to moderate for precise break‑by‑break face estimates and timing of the Saturday reinforcement.</p>
<p>Bottom line
- Expect very large, powerful NNW surf across the North Shore Oct 16–17 with the cleanest conditions in the early morning while winds remain light ENE. Additional NW/WNW pulses are likely late Saturday (Oct 18) and could further elevate risk and size. Use extreme caution — these conditions exceed high‑surf advisory thresholds and are only for experienced big‑wave crews.</p>

            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Caldwell-style South Shore forecast — 2025-10-16 → 2025-**10-18</p>
<p>S<strong>ummary (quick take)
- Primary driver: a SW pulse (13 s) that registered strongly on offshore buoys; geometry gives moderate wrap onto the South Shore. Expect the biggest energy on the 16th with a steady decay through the 17th–18th. Background Southern Hemi activity is low for this time of year, so nothing new to prop the south side up after the initial pulse.
- Size (best-estimate, surf scale = Hawaiian): Oct 16 — </strong>2–4 ft<strong> (H1/3) with occasional </strong>3–6 ft<strong> H1/10 sets at the most exposed reef windows. Oct 17 — 1.</strong>5–3 ft<strong> (H1/3), H1/10 to ~2.</strong>5–4 ft<strong>. Oct 18 — 1–2.</strong>5 ft<strong> (H1/3), H1/10 to ~2–3.</strong>5 ft**. Expect variability by exposure; exposed outside reefs will see the upper end of these ranges.
- Confidence: medium (0.68/1). Buoy and tide/port data solid; missing altimetry, nearshore buoys and model feeds increase uncertainty in exact nearshore decay and local wrap angles.</p>
<p>Opening assessment — size, direction, timing
- The strongest measured energy in the data set is a SW 13 s pulse (deepwater H1/3 ≈ 16.<strong>4 ft</strong>). That deepwater number is large but highly reduced by propagation, island blocking and local exposure — the South Shore will not see that number inshore. With the recorded SW vector and an exposure weight ~0.50, the practical nearshore outcome is a moderate southerly swell energy burst arriving 16–24 hrs after the buoy observation window and peaking on Oct 16. Peak periods near the coast will be ~<strong>11–13 s</strong> from the SW–SSW quadrant with sets most consistent during the day on Oct 16, then tapering through the 17th and into the 18th.
- Background Southern Hemi pulses are weak for this period (climatology and available buoy data), so after this SW burst subsidence is expected rather than reinforcement.</p>
<p>Wrap potential and swell interaction
- Geometry: the SW source has a good bearing to wrap into southeast-facing windows (Diamond Head and parts of Waikiki) — expect punchier, longer-period sets at outside reefs where the angle is more favorable. Town-facing reefs (Ala Moana, mid-Waikiki) see a softer, more refracted version of the same pulse.
- Cross-swell/confusion: by Oct 18 multiple north/NW pulses from Gulf Alaska/Aleutian fetch are forecast to arrive (see physics-based arrivals). Those will be primarily north energy; when they overlap with residual SW energy expect some confused, shorter-period lumps and onshore chop at times — not ideal for pure south-swell lines but it will create erratic peaks and increased current/rip potential.</p>
<p>Local winds &amp; diurnal trends
- Latest obs: 070° at 8 kt (light ENE/ENE-ish). Light ENE trades are generally favorable for the South Shore — they tend to be cross-shore to slightly offshore at many south-facing breaks early day, delivering cleaner faces.
- Expect mornings to be the cleanest each day while winds remain light. Sea-breeze tendencies can push winds more SSE–S in the afternoon, increasing texture and onshore component on the 16th–18th. Monitor local radar/obs; a switch to S–SSE would dull the lines and favor short, punchy sets over long, clean walls.</p>
<p>Town reefs vs. outlier breaks — specifics
- Waikiki (Queens / Canoes)
  - Oct 16: Rideable, more consistent on the outer points. Period ~<strong>12–13 s</strong> will open up longer runners at Canoes; sets will be chest–shoulder for longboards and small shortboards. Expect the best windows in the calm morning.
  - Oct 17–18: Softer; Canoes/Queens become more longboard-friendly with fewer long runners. Crowd mild to moderate; locals will show up for glassy conditions.
- Ala Moana Bowl
  - Typically a fatter, more wind-affected break. On the 16th expect occasional punchy bowls on larger sets but overall it will prefer the lower end of the pulse — better for longboarders and cruising logs. Mid to high tide windows will fill in best.
- Diamond Head / outside reefs
  - Picks up the most direct energy and wrap. On Oct 16 expect the cleanest, most powerful peaks here — shoulder to occasional head-high faces for experienced shortboarders where the period remains <strong>11–13 s</strong>. Diamond Head performs best on mid to incoming tide; expect the best quality in the morning to early afternoon before any sea-breeze builds.
- Outliers (east-facing points and reef windows)
  - Where the angle allows, expect punchy, fast walls that will favor shortboards; however these will be inconsistent and will come in sets separated by longer lulls.</p>
<p>Longboard vs. shortboard suitability and crowd/consistency
- Oct 16: Mixed conditions. Longboarders will find reliable lines at Waikiki/Canoes and Ala Moana on the smaller, refracted energy; shortboarders should target Diamond Head/outside peaks at the peaks of the sets. Expect intermittent high-quality sets rather than steady overhead surf.
- Oct 17–18: Best for longboarders and funboarders as the pulse fades — more consistent small-to-medium runners. Shortboarders will see fewer clean high-performance opportunities and more lump/confused windows as NW energy begins to interfere.
- Crowd notes: Cleaner mornings → larger crowds on the good windows. When Diamond Head lights up expect the advanced cohort to show; town beaches will remain busy on fair mornings.</p>
<p>Tides &amp; timing
- Recent tide obs show low to mid tidal range at night (latest obs ~1.<strong>75 ft</strong>). For South Shore reefs:
  - Diamond Head: favors mid to high tide for shape and peel.
  - Waikiki/Ala Moana: fills best on mid to high tide; certain runs at Canoes are best on the incoming.
- Plan sessions for morning mid-tide windows through Oct 16–17 for the best combination of tide and light winds.</p>
<p>Hazards &amp; safety
- Increased rip currents during the decay phase and when cross/contrasting swell components overlap. The larger outside sets at Diamond Head carry stronger currents and faster closeouts — only experienced surfers should paddle out on the peak energy of Oct 16.
- Confused seas expected by Oct 18 as north/fetch components arrive — stronger chop and erratic sets increase the risk of wipeouts.</p>
<p>Gear and strategy
- Oct 16: Shortboard for Diamond Head/outside peaks; 5’8–6’3 depending on comfort. For Waikiki and Ala Moana, longboard or mini‑mal recommended for more catchable, smoother rides.
- Oct 17–18: Logs and longboards feel best, funboards also fine. Shortboarders pick mornings for cleaner lines; afternoons likely bumpier.</p>
<p>Data confidence &amp; caveats
- Confidence medium (0.68/1). Buoy coverage producing the core swell signal is good; however missing altimetry, nearshore buoys, satellite imagery and model feeds reduce precision on how much deepwater energy refracts and attenuates into each local window. Treat the size ranges above as best-estimate envelopes; local variations will be significant between exposed outside reefs and sheltered town points.</p>
<p>Bottom line
- Expect a clear SW-driven peak on Oct 16 with the best, punchiest lines at Diamond Head and rideable longboard conditions at Waikiki/Ala Moana. Energy fades through the 17th–18th; north arrivals late in the period will increase confusion and chop. Morning sessions look best each day while winds remain light.</p>
<p>If you want I can run a location-specific estimate (Ala Moana, Queens, Diamond Head) with tighter H1/3 and H1/10 nearshore conversions and recommended session windows based on the next available tide predictions.</p>

        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>HEADLINE: Massive mixed NNW/NW + SW energy — North Shore bombs and south-facing spots raw; only experienced big-wave crews today, best window early while winds stay light.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE: Faces 15–25+ ft (occasional XXL sets); primary energy NNW/NW (<strong>13–15s</strong>) — peak already in, holds through today; best window: dawn → late morning for cleaner lines before any radar wind build.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE: Faces 12–18+ ft on exposed points from strong SW 13s energy — steep, powerful sets and heavy shorebreak at reef/point exits; best window: early morning; expect big, fast waves all day.</p>
<p>EAST / WEST quick hits:
- East: Protected coves small-to-moderate; strong current risk near river mouths.
- West: WNW component (<strong>7–13s</strong>) adds punch to west-facing points — expect sizable, punchy surf and heavy rips.</p>
<p>WINDS: Observed 070° at ~8 kt (ENE light trades) — light enough to keep many spots relatively clean this morning; east component is side-shore on north-facing breaks and side/on for south spots (creases on some exposures). If winds pick up later, expect choppiness on exposed south and west faces — aim for first light.</p>

<li>Current: ~1.<strong>75 ft</strong> at 00:18 HST (latest obs).</li>
<li>Recent low: ~0.<strong>2 ft</strong> at 19:05 HST (Oct 15).</li>
<li>Expect tide to be rising through the morning toward the next mid-day high — plan for stronger currents and faster shorebreak during the run-up to high.</li>
</ul>
<p>HAZARDS (actionable): Very large, heavy surf with strong rips, shifting currents, and dangerous shorebreak; shallow reef exits and big sets can close out unexpectedly — rescue crews will be busy.</p>
<p>ACTION ITEM: Go only if you’re experienced with big-wave conditions and have a support plan (spotter/boat/PPE); otherwise sit it out or choose a protected east-facing break early AM. Optimal timing: first light → late morning while winds remain light.</p>
