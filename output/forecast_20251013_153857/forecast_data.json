Shorter\u2011period Gulf Alaska energy and dateline/Aleutian pulses follow mid\u2011 to late week (Oct 16\u201317). Trades remain in the pattern \u2014 short\u2011period E/SE wind swell and chop will contaminate face quality at times. Overall confidence: 0.6/1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- Long\u2011period NW groundswell (primary): Physics propagation predicts the Gulf of Alaska pulse (6 ft H1/3 @ 18s) to begin impacting Oahu early 10/15 (01:10 HST). This is backed by pressure\u2011chart fetch: deep 966 mb low near 50N/170W with a tight gradient to a 1035 mb high \u2014 efficient long\u2011period generation. Expect dominant arrival to favor exposed north and northwest reefs; verify with regional buoys (suggest 51001, 51002, 46089 for North Pacific checks) and WW3/OPC updates. Confidence moderate.\n- Secondary shorter NW energy: A shorter 10 s Gulf Alaska component (5 ft H1/3) is forecast ~10/16; expect elevated period mix and a slightly windier, lumpier character ahead of/behind the main 18s pulse.\n- Dateline / Aleutian pulses: Multiple Aleutian\u2011track arrivals (11\u201314 s, H1/3 \u2248 4 ft) are timed for ~10/17 \u2014 they sit just beyond the requested window but will modulate the tail of the Oct 15\u201316 sea state. Pressure\u2011chart analysis shows sustained frontal activity across 35\u201355N that supplies this energy.\n- E/SE trades and wind swell: Buoy matrix and satellite/cloud fields indicate active tradewind cumulus and persistent easterly trades \u2014 a 5.6 ft H1/3 @ 9 s ESE component was observed (matrix window 10/10). Expect short\u2011period wind swell and surface chop on east and southeast exposures during the period; METAR at PHNL (2025\u201110\u201110 23:53 HST) showed light variable winds (VRB03KT) but satellite and pressure charts indicate trades will remain a factor.\n- Small S / SSE contributions: Low\u2011significance southern energy (S 3.0 ft @ 12s; SSE 2.3 ft @11s in the matrix) is present as background. Southern hemispheric storms are noted on SIG WAVE charts but arrivals to Hawaii are likely later and reduced by decay/shadowing.\n\nBuoy/tide references: matrix swell components derived from buoy observations (matrix entries list \u201cbuoy\u201d as source \u2014 exposure weights unavailable). For verification use NDBC buoys 51001, 51002, 46089 and local station/tide: NOAA 1612340 (latest obs 2025\u201110\u201111 00:00 HST: 0.45 ft). Recommended checks: KVM\u201170 surface analyses, OPC 24\u201372 hr wave forecasts, NDBC spectral plots before committing to big exposures.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Oct 13\u201314: small to moderate leftover northerly energy with short\u2011period lump from trades; H1/3 likely in the 2\u20134 ft range at many breaks. Cleaner windows possible pre\u2011dawn if trades relax, but expect intermittent chop.\n- Oct 15 (early AM): main call \u2014 Gulf Alaska 18s pulse arrives (~01:10 HST). Expect H1/3 \u2248 6 ft (Hawaiian scale) on exposed north/northwest reefs; estimated H1/10 set faces 9\u201314 ft depending on reef geometry and local focusing. Biggest sets will favor deep, fast\u2011reforming points and reef steps (e.g., Ehukai, Rocky Point, Velzyland on north shore exposures). Expect increased current/push and strong shorebreak on shallow reefs.\n- Winds/tides: trades and a nearby subtropical ridge (1019\u20131035 mb) will keep east trades active around the island; if trades persist, the long\u2011period pulse will be wind\u2011chopped on windward exposures and cleaner on protected NW points. Confidence moderate (0.6); verify periods on buoys \u2014 >14\u201316 s = big long\u2011period groundswell arrival signature.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Fall pattern: south season winding down. Expect largely small conditions through Oct 15 \u2014 matrix shows S 3.0 ft @ 12 s and SSE 2.3 ft @ 11 s as weak background energy. H1/3 generally 2\u20133 ft; H1/10 smaller (3\u20135 ft faces) at best on deep sand beaches.\n- Eastern Pacific convective cluster off Mexico noted in satellite imagery could produce a faster southerly pulse if it consolidates, but current guidance flags low probability for a strong, direct south swell to Hawaii within the 3\u2011day window. Monitor tropical updates (NHC/Central Pacific) \u2014 Tropical Storm Raymond is well east/southeast of Hawaii and not expected to affect swell here.\n- Expect onshore/easterly trades to produce short\u2011period chop on southeast exposures and make small south swells feel messy.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 2025-10-15)\n- Oct 16\u201318: main Gulf Alaska pulse should be on the decline after 10/15 peak but will leave a long\u2011period tail and increased NW energy through Oct 16. The shorter 10 s Gulf Alaska component may peak ~10/16 (physics arrival 10/16 02:42 HST).\n- Oct 17 onward: Aleutian/dateline pulses (11\u201314 s H1/3 \u2248 4 ft per physics) begin to arrive ~10/17 and could re\u2011energize NW exposures \u2014 expect fluctuating period mix and persistent north/northwest energy through the week. Watch for constructive interference and directional shifts that can focus larger sets on particular reefs.\n- Southern hemi energy: trailing southern lows flagged in pressure charts may send small to moderate S/SSE energy out 8\u201312 days (watch late\u2011week into next week). Eastern Pacific convective activity remains a conditional wildcard \u2014 if it intensifies into a tropical cyclone it could produce meaningful southerly swell in 3\u20135 days; current satellite shows only a compact convective cluster.\n- Recommended follow\u2011ups: check NDBC buoy spectral plots and WW3/OPC model updates at 12\u201324 hr cadence. Key buoys: 51001, 51002, 46089; verify local winds and buoy periods before heading to exposed north/west spots.\n\nData gaps / caveats\n- Matrix entries cite \u201cbuoy\u201d but do not provide explicit buoy IDs or spectral energy breakdowns; exposure weighting is unavailable. Satellite composite lacked IR/wv timestamped channels in the digest. These gaps reduce exact arrival\u2013height precision. Use the physics arrivals as a timing guide and cross\u2011check with buoy spectral peaks and WW3 model guidance before committing to big exposures.\n\n\u2014 Pat \"SwellCaldWell\" Caldwell, Surf News Network. Confidence (forecast): 0.6/1.0.",
  "north_shore": "Lead: Through Mon\u2013Wed (Oct 13\u201315) the North Shore will be riding leftover northerly/NE energy \u2014 buoy data show ~6.2 ft H1/3 at 10\u201311 s (rough H1/10 \u2248 8 ft) from N to NE sources \u2014 with a fresher Gulf\u2011Alaska long\u2011period pulse (modelled 6 ft @ 18 s) expected to start arriving early Wednesday (Oct 15 ~ 01:10 HST). Expect clean but punchy north\u2011to\u2011NE faces early in the window, with increased power and longer\u2011period punch as the 18 s energy fills in Wednesday AM.\n\nWind / tide interplay (short): Buoys and METARs currently show light, variable surface winds (PHNL VRB03KT). That favors early morning sessions \u2014 reef breaks will be relatively clean before daytime trades build. Typical fall trade pickup (E\u2013NE in the afternoon) will make exposed north corners and wide beach breaks windier and lumpier by late morning/afternoon. Tides will modulate shape: lower tides emphasize hollow reef lines (Pipeline/Sunset), mid\u2013high tides sweeten Waimea runs but also deepen takeoff zones. Timing uncertainty: the Gulf\u2011Alaska 18 s arrival time has moderate timing error (\u00b16\u201312 hr), so plan for the pulse from late Tue night into Wed morning.\n\nFlagship breaks \u2014 expectations\n- Ehukai / Pipeline (Banzai): Current N\u2013NE 10\u201311 s energy will produce solid, hollow reeftop faces \u2014 estimated 6\u20138 ft H1/3 (H1/10 ~8 ft) with steep takeoffs. If the 18 s pulse arrives as modelled it will steepen sets and increase hold \u2014 expect bigger, more powerful barrels Wed AM. Best windows: early morning on light winds and a lower tide. Confidence moderate \u2014 direction shift from NE\u2192NNW would change peak zone along the reef.\n- Sunset Beach: Responds to both the existing N/NE energy and the longer 18 s pulse. Expect long, powerful north\u2011facing walls and increased set intervals; faces roughly 6\u201310 ft H1/3 depending on local refraction, and much more punch on the 18 s component. Early sessions will be cleaner; mid\u2011day trades will add texture. Watch for strong bowl\u2011to\u2011closeouts on big sets.\n- Waimea Bay: Currently mellow compared with classic winter big days but the incoming Gulf\u2011Alaska 18 s energy is the one to watch \u2014 it will preferentially load large north\u2011exposed points and Waimea\u2019s shelf. If the pulse trends a touch more NNW than modelled, expect rapid size escalation Wed AM with powerful long\u2011period sets; estimated ramp into big\u2011swell territory for experienced teams (uncertainty high \u2014 monitor real\u2011time buoys).\n- (Optional) Velzyland / Rocky Points: Cleaner on NE wind angles; expect fun hollow walls on the current 10\u201311 s background and longer drawn\u2011out faces if the 18 s pulse hooks more NW.\n\nHazards: No formal big\u2011swell advisory flagged in this forecast, but the Wednesday 18 s pulse has the potential to push some exposed spots toward advisory thresholds. Long\u2011period energy increases shoreward runup, strong rips, and dangerous wash\u2011throughs \u2014 even 6\u20138 ft H1/3 at 18 s packs far more punch than short period surf. If local lifeguards post advisories or beaches close, obey instructions. For the general public: strong currents, big shorebreak on shallow sandbars, and powerful shoreward surges are the primary hazards to watch.\n\nUncertainties & confidence: Data coverage is good (12/13 buoys, charts/satellite/tides successful). Overall forecast confidence is medium (0.64/1.00). The main uncertainties are (1) the exact timing and amplitude of the Gulf\u2011Alaska 18 s pulse (modelled arrival Wed 01:10 HST, confidence ~75%, timing \u00b16\u201312 hr), and (2) small changes in swell angle that will shift which reefs see the biggest faces. Expect \u00b11\u20132 ft sizing uncertainty across exposed points; monitor real\u2011time buoys and coastal reports for the Wednesday pulse.",
  "south_shore": "Opening assessment (size, direction, timing)\n- Summary: South Shore will be driven by a modest S\u2013ESE pulse with a secondary SSE component \u2014 steady but not large for mid\u2011October. Expect the most consistent energy from the S 3.0 ft @ 12 s source (exposure weight 0.96) with ESE 5.6 ft @ 9 s and SSE 2.3 ft @ 11 s providing directional texture and occasional punch.\n- H1/3 / H1/10 estimates (best practical ranges for Oct 13\u201315):\n  - Exposed points / Diamond Head / Kewalos: H1/3 ~ 3.0\u20134.0 ft (H1/10 \u2248 3.8\u20135.0 ft) at peak sets.\n  - Town breaks / Ala Moana / Point Panic: H1/3 ~ 2.0\u20133.0 ft (H1/10 \u2248 2.6\u20133.8 ft).\n  - Protected inside Waikiki and small reef pockets: H1/3 ~ 1.5\u20132.5 ft (H1/10 \u2248 2.0\u20133.2 ft).\n- Timing: energy is already present and will hold through the period. The strongest direct S energy is present throughout Oct 13\u201315. A large north (Gulf Alaska) long\u2011period arrival is forecast very early Oct 15 (6 ft @ 18 s arriving ~01:10 HST) \u2014 that will be primarily a north swell but could introduce cross\u2011seas and confused sets late on the 14th into the 15th.\n\nTown vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head) \u2014 tides & winds\n- Waikiki (inside breaks): Very consistent and forgiving. With the 9\u201312 s periods on the street, expect long, rideable faces in the waist\u2011to\u2011chest range. Because Waikiki is sheltered, it will be the cleanest option if a light northerly component arrives with the Gulf Alaska pulse.\n- Ala Moana / Point Panic: Responds well to ESE\u2013SSE energy \u2014 expect chest to head\u2011high sets on the outside sections at peak. Tends to be punchier than Waikiki but still friendly for intermediate longboarders. Mid\u2011tide windows usually best here; check local tide \u2014 small tidal range now but timing matters for peak sections.\n- Diamond Head / Kewalos (outlier points): Most exposed to S\u2013SSE/ESE wrap. When the S 12 s component lines up you\u2019ll see steeper, more punchy right and left peaks \u2014 these are the best windows for shortboards. Diamond Head will be the biggest, most critical venue for performance riders during higher sets.\n- Winds / best windows: Current METAR (PHNL) reports very light variable winds (VRB03KT). That pattern and the seasonal lull in trades favor clean early\u2011morning conditions. Expect light seabreeze development in the afternoons; mornings will be the best surf windows for clean faces Oct 13\u201315.\n- Tides: Latest sea level obs are low (\u22480.45 ft). Tidal amplitude is small this period \u2014 plan sessions around mid to slightly rising tide for best point and reef shape, and avoid the lowest lows at exposed points if you\u2019re after punchy sections.\n\nWrap potential and background southern\u2011hemisphere pulses\n- Wrap analysis: Fall primary directions for the South Shore are S to SSW. The S 3.0 ft @ 12 s source (high exposure weight) is the direct driver \u2014 it will push into point reefs and wrap into protected town breaks reliably. ESE 5.6 ft @ 9 s (moderate exposure) and the SSE component will give additional angularity: ESE/SSE energy produces better backswell/fill into Ala Moana and Diamond Head\u2019s more easterly facets.\n- Southern\u2011hemisphere pulses: We have only modest southern inputs on the charts for this period (ESE/SSE small\u2013moderate). No large southern hemi train is forecast to arrive on Oct 13\u201315, so expect steady background S\u2011energy rather than a new big southern pulse. The primary risk to south\u2011facing consistency over these days is the north long\u2011period arrival (~Oct 15), which can create cross\u2011sea interference rather than boosting southshore size.\n\nLongboard vs shortboard suitability and crowd/consistency expectations\n- Longboards: Ideal at Waikiki and Ala Moana across the whole window \u2014 clean, rolling faces with 9\u201312 s periods and light winds make for very good longboard conditions. Expect long runs, especially on rising to mid tide.\n- Shortboards: Diamond Head and Kewalos are the targets for shortboard performance \u2014 steeper faces and punchier sections on the larger sets. Shortboarders should aim for early mornings or moments when S and ESE align; watch for increased confusion when the north swell wraps in late on Oct 14\u201315.\n- Crowds: Expect typical weekday/weekend patterns \u2014 Waikiki and Ala Moana will attract the most people (reliable, forgiving waves). Diamond Head will be more selective and thus more crowded when the sets lift. Plan for higher numbers at dawn and late afternoon peak windows.\n\nOperational notes, hazards and final guidance\n- Expect clean mornings with light, variable winds; afternoons can trend toward a light seabreeze. Check the morning wind report before committing to the peak break.\n- The arriving Gulf Alaska long\u2011period swell (arriving ~01:10 HST Oct 15) is northern energy \u2014 it won\u2019t massively increase southshore height but can generate confused cross\u2011seas, stronger currents, and occasional inconsistent sets late on the 14th into the 15th. Steer clear of tricky ledge/rock areas if conditions get mixed.\n- Always check the exact local tide chart for your launch time \u2014 small tide swings now but local reef and point performance is tide\u2011sensitive.\n\nConfidence statement\n- Overall confidence: medium (0.64/1.00). Data coverage was good (buoys 12/13, charts 3/3, METAR 2/2, satellite 1/1, tides 2/2, tropical 1/1) and detected multiple swell components. The S 3.0 ft @ 12 s source is the highest\u2011weight driver for the South Shore this period; however, cross\u2011sea potential from the Gulf Alaska arrival (~Oct 15 early AM) introduces uncertainty in set consistency late in the window. Check updated buoy and local wind observations if planning sessions on Oct 14\u201315.\n\nBottom line: Expect a steady S\u2013ESE mix Oct 13\u201315 with clean morning surf and reliable longboard conditions at Waikiki/Ala Moana. Shortboard performance windows at Diamond Head/Kewalos will be available on larger sets; late on Oct 14 into Oct 15 watch for cross\u2011sea confusion from an incoming north long\u2011period swell.",
  "daily": "HEADLINE \u2014 Light variable winds; leftover NE/N energy still favors the North Shore at dawn for surfable, occasionally head-high+ sets; south/east small and cleaner.\n\nNORTH SHORE \u2014 Faces: NE \u2192 N; size: expect occasional head\u2011high to overhead sets at exposed points (roughly 6\u20138 ft faces at the peak of sets based on recent buoys, but likely fading); best window: dawn \u2192 late morning; hazards: strong rips, big sets, shallow reef at popular breaks \u2014 experienced surfers only on peak sets.\n\nSOUTH SHORE \u2014 Faces: S \u2192 SSE; size: small (knee\u2011to\u2011chest to occasional waist\u2011high); best window: morning\u2192midday for cleaner conditions; hazards: local rips, crowded lineups \u2014 good option for longboards/longboarders and beginners at protected beaches.\n\nEAST/WEST \u2014 East: E/ENE energy wrapping into protected points \u2014 fun small\u2011to\u2011waist high rides in light winds.
