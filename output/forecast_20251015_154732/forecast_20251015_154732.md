### Summary
Dominant energy: long‑period NW fetch from a deep dateline storm — large offshore buoy signatures (H1/3 up to ~**17 ft** on 10/14) have already propagated toward Hawaii. Expect residual big NW sets through Oct 15–16, then additional modeled NW pulses arriving Oct 17–18 (multiple **4–5 ft** @ **13–18 s** deep‑water pulses per physics runs). East trades are active (PHNL METAR 080° at 16 kt gusting 23 kt) — expect wind chop on exposed faces. Forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0.

### Details
- Dateline NW pulse (primary): buoy spectral reads show a powerful long‑period NW arrival 10/14 (H1/3 = 17.**1 ft** @ 16 s; 322°). That pulse is already en route/arrived as of 10/14–15 and should be in decline through 10/15–16 offshore; energy will remain high on exposed north/northwest reefs. Buoys to verify: check 51028 (Midway/central Pacific proxy) and nearest operational Hawaiian buoy (51001 or local NDBC entries).
- Secondary NW/NNW components: spectral energy at **14–15 s** (H1/3 11.8–16.**4 ft**) will lengthen the surf window for peaky sets and cross‑directional surf. Buoy spectral entries (digest: buoy_spectral) confirm multi‑band NW energy; exposure weights unavailable — local reef geometry will sort set impact.
- Modelled follow‑on pulses (physics arrivals): multiple modeled arrivals show **5 ft** @ 13s (arrive Fri 10/17 11:33 AM HST — Aleutian run), **5 ft** @ **13–14s** Friday night → Saturday (10/17–10/18) and a stronger **5 ft** @ 18s late 10/18 (Aleutian 18s pulse) — each with ~70–75% model confidence. These are deep‑water model heights; local reef amplification and bathymetry can produce significantly larger H1/10 set faces at exposed spots.
- Local winds/tides: PHNL METAR 142353Z shows 080° 16G23 kt — trades favor wind chop on windward and exposed NW faces during daylight. Tide station NOAA 1612340 latest obs 2.**04 ft** (10/14 14:00 HST); tide phase will modulate break timing — check local tide tables for high/low during sessions.
- Data gaps: exposure weights and real‑time buoy time‑series for the specific offshore stations in the digest are not embedded in these charts. I recommend immediate confirmation on NDBC buoys 51028, 51001, 51004 and NE Pacific buoys 46089/46012 for the shorter‑period components.

NORTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- What to expect (10/15–10/17): Residual large long‑period NW energy through 10/15–16 with peaky, powerful sets on exposed reefs (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea). Expect a relative lull/fade mid‑day 10/16 followed by re‑energizing pulses arriving 10/17–18 per physics model (timed pulses of **4–5 ft** @ **13–18 s** deep‑water; local set faces will be larger). Confidence moderate (0.6).
- Spot guidance:
  - Ehukai / Pipeline: Very exposed. Long‑period pulses will produce heavy, hollow sets. Hold for experienced big‑wave crews only. Expect unpredictable interval and powerful backwash.
  - Sunset: Bombing, especially on long **16–18 s** energy arrivals. Sets will look bigger and move faster than shorter‑period wind‑seas.
  - Waimea: Southern portion of the fetch favors north‑facing reef amplification — potential for big wave conditions during peak pulses (expect shore‑breaky, fast faces). Use swell models + local buoys before committing.
- Winds/tide: Easterly trades 15–25 kt will add chop to open faces; early mornings may offer slightly cleaner windows before sea breeze onshore peak. Check NOAA tide station 1612340 for exact high/low timing — tides will be critical for proper hold‑up/run‑up on big reefs.
- Hazards: Strong rips, heavy shorebreak, and rapid set size changes. Multi‑band interference expected; currents and unpredictable set intervals make these days high risk.

SOUTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- What to expect (10/15–10/17): Minimal direct energy from the NW dateline storm on true south exposures. South swell season is waning; any S/SSW energy is small background. The southern hemisphere fetch shown on charts may produce a small long‑range S/SE pulse later (7–11 days out), not within this 3‑day window.
- Spot guidance:
  - Ala Moana / Waikiki: Expect small, wind‑affected surf; winds from 080° are cross‑onshore and will make conditions choppy.
  - Makaha / west‑facing points: Protected from direct north, but long NW energy wrapping can produce chest‑to‑head high sets at exposed west points if angle wraps — monitor buoys.
- Confidence and notes: High confidence that south‑facing spots will be smaller than north exposures over the next 72 hours. Watch for background S/SSW arrivals beyond Oct 18 per southern fetch signals.

OUTLOOK (beyond 10/17)
- 10/17–10/18: Physics runs show multiple new NW pulses arriving — listed arrivals include:
  - Fri 10/17 11:33 AM HST — Aleutian pulse ~**5 ft** @ 13 s (dist ~865 nm) (conf 75%).
  - Fri 10/17 10:52 PM HST — Gulf Alaska ~**5 ft** @ 13 s (conf 75%).
  - Sat 10/18 02:15 AM HST — Aleutian ~**5 ft** @ 18 s (larger period energy) (conf 75%).
  - Sat 10/18 through evening — multiple **5 ft** @ **13–14 s** arrivals (conf 70–75%).
  These model arrivals suggest a re‑energizing NW window starting late 10/17 into 10/18 with long‑period energy that can produce bigger set faces at north/northwest reefs.
- Winds: Subtropical high east of Hawaii is strengthening trades — expect persistent easterlies (15–25 kt) that will degrade clean lines on arrival and produce wind‑swells and surface chop.
- Tropical cues: Central Pacific tropical outlook: no genesis expected next 7 days (CPC NHC). Southern hemisphere cyclone energy exists but arrival for Hawaii is 7–11 days out and low–moderate confidence.
- Verification checklist: Recheck NDBC buoys 51028 and 51001 for period/height spectra, and local coastal buoys (51004 / 46089) for NE Pacific components. Confirm WW3/ECMWF wave model runs for updated arrival times and H1/10 conversions before big‑wave operations.

Caveats / Final note
- Primary driver: dateline storm — satellite and pressure charts corroborate strong long‑period NW fetch. However, chart images lack the full buoy time‑series and exposure weighting used to translate offshore H1/3 into exact local set faces. Use buoy confirmations (51028, 51001), local cams and tide checks (NOAA 1612340) prior to decision making. Forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0.

## North Shore Forecast

Lead: From Oct 15–17 the North Shore will be driven by a large NW groundswell observed on buoys Oct 14 — H1/3 in the **15–17 ft** range with H1/10 roughly **20–22 ft** and long periods (**13–16 s**). That main pulse will be on the water and decaying through Oct 15–16, with additional Aleutian/Gulf Alaska energy likely beginning to arrive late on Oct 17.

Wind / tide interplay (quick read)
- Buoy/METAR wind obs show an E–ENE trade around 15–20 kt (PHNL 08016G23kt). For north-facing reef breaks that’s largely side‑off to offshore — it will clean faces at the classic north points through much of the day and help hold hollow lines.  
- Gusty trades will push sand and produce bump/side chop on more westward exposures (Sunset, parts of Haleʻiwa) and will increase shore-spray on exposed ledges. If the wind backs toward N or NW the swell will get wind-rough quickly and several spots will close out.  
- Tide: small to moderate tidal range right now; mid-to-lower tides generally favor tighter, more hollow Reef takeoffs at Pipeline/Sunset. With this size however, mid/high tides will translate into much heavier shore-break and shore-punch — expect thicker, more dangerous closeouts on reef and beach takes.

Flagship break notes (expected faces/conditions)
- Pipeline (Ehukai) — Expect heavy, hollow NW lines. Buoy energy (**15–17 ft** H1/3, **13–16 s**) translates to very large, powerful faces at Pipeline (H1/10-level bomb sets 18–24+ ft). Clean on a steady E–ENE wind; extremely hazardous — only for elite big-wave surfers and tow teams while lifeguards/boats are on alert.  
- Sunset Beach — Long-period NW will build long, powerful sets. Faces will be very large (H1/3 high double-digit Hawaiian; H1/10 in the **18–22 ft** band on big sets). More exposed to sideshore wind so expect some lump; heavy inside shorebreak/wash-through on bigger tides.  
- Waimea Bay — Long-period NW energy and period will funnel into Waimea; expect big, infrequent sets (H1/10 well above normal big-wave thresholds). Tow-capable or experienced paddle teams only. Current/shore interactions will be strong.  
- Haleʻiwa / Freshwater (Velzyland area) — Powerful, fast rippable peaks on the outside reef on the bigger sets, then substantial shorewash inside. Cleaner under E‑NE trades; will get messy quickly if winds shift.

Hazards
- Heights sampled by buoys put many North Shore breaks into big-wave advisory territory (large H1/3 and H1/10 estimates > ~**20 ft** on sets). Expect life‑threatening shorebreaks, strong rip currents, wash-throughs and dangerous currents at river mouths and harbor mouths. Access, rescue and boat operations will be high risk. Local lifeguards’ advice and closures should be heeded.  

Confidence and key uncertainties
- Overall confidence: medium (0.64). Buoy coverage is good (12/13), charts/satellite/meteors all reporting, so the presence of a large NW pulse is well supported.  
- Main uncertainty: timing and decay-rate of the Oct 14 pulse into Oct 15–16 (windows on the buoy data cluster on Oct 14) — that makes precise face heights and set frequency for Oct 15–16 moderately uncertain. Follow-up Aleutian/Gulf Alaska arrivals for Oct 17–18 are forecast with ~70–75% model/propagation confidence; actual timing and peak energy could shift ±6–12 hours.  
- If winds veer to N/NW or strengthen beyond current obs, expect quicker degradation and more closing-out at the north points; if trades remain E–ENE, expect cleaner, more hollow lines.

Bottom line: Big, powerful NW groundswell through Oct 15–16 with additional pulses likely by late Oct 17. Conditions will be offshore‑clean in the trades but remain extremely dangerous — only experienced big-wave teams should consider these sessions. Check local lifeguard advisories and real‑time buoy/wind updates before heading out.

## South Shore Forecast

Summary opening
Expect a quiet South Shore run Oct 15–17: no fused, direct SSW groundswells in the ingest. Background south-swell energy will be small and fading (typical fall **1–3 ft** Hawaiian), with late-period wrap potential from incoming N/NW storm energy—most likely a modest, short-period wrap rather than a true southerly pulse. Observations and buoys are solid (12/13 buoys, full chart/meteorology coverage) so we’re confident in the low-energy outcome but remain watchful for the NW arrivals late on the 17th.

1) Size / direction / timing (H1/3 and H1/10 estimates)
- Oct 15 (Wed): H1/3 ~ 1.0–1.**5 ft** (H1/10 ≈ 1.3–2.**0 ft**). Dominant energy: light S–SSW background; mostly locally generated short-period energy. Best windows: early morning cleaner before trades build.
- Oct 16 (Thu): H1/3 ~ 0.8–1.**4 ft** (H1/10 ≈ 1.0–1.**8 ft**). Similar S–SSW background; overall a touch smaller/less organized than the 15th.
- Oct 17 (Fri): H1/3 ~ 1.0–2.**0 ft** (H1/10 ≈ 1.3–2.**6 ft**) overall, with a chance of localized bump late day as NW/Gulf-AK/Aleutian energy begins to wrap into southern exposures (see physics-based arrivals arriving 17th/18th). If wrap trends more southerly in the propagation field, expect the largest increase after mid‑day on the 17th.

2) Wrap potential & southern-hemisphere pulses
- Current fused dataset shows no active southern-hemisphere pulses. Southern hemi contribution for this period is negligible.
- Wrap potential is the main mechanism to watch: multiple N/NW buoy-detected events on Oct 14 and physics-mode arrivals from Aleutian/Gulf Alaska (arrivals flagged for Oct 17–18) create a realistic pathway for some long-period NW energy to refract/ diffract into south-facing lines. Expect only modest wrap for the 15–16 window; the stronger possibility for measurable wrap is late on Oct 17. This will produce more angled, steeper lines at exposed reef pockets rather than a broad clean southerly groundswelling of the whole shore.

3) Local winds, diurnal pattern, and impact
- Latest METAR (PHNL 142353Z) shows E (080°) 16 kt gusting 23 kt. Trades are in control.
- Forecast expectation: typical fall trade pattern — lighter in the morning (5–10 kt) and strengthening into the afternoon (10–18 kt, with gusts). East‑to‑ENE trades produce onshore to cross‑onshore conditions for most south-facing breaks, increasing chop and flattening waist‑high sets. Morning low-wind windows will be the cleanest for the small south components; late afternoons will be bumpier.
- Small NW wrap energy will show up cleaner on east‑southeast oriented points when winds dial back in the mornings; stronger afternoon trades will mute what little wrap arrives.

4) Town vs outlier breaks — specifics (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head)
- Ala Moana Park / Kewalo Basin
  - Expect small, often weak, shore‑punchy rides. Ala Moana is picky: prefers clean S swell and light trades. Morning sessions still best; midday-afternoon trades usually ruin any marginal peaks. Tidal note: mid to higher tides fill the bank and can help lengthen weak lines—plan for morning mid/high tide windows.
- Waikiki (Canoes, Queens, Outrigger)
  - Most consistent for small background S energy. Longboard/foamie sessions will be the norm. Canoes and Queens will produce the most forgiving, rideable lines on the 15–16th. Crowds remain high with small surf.
- Diamond Head / Kaimana
  - Diamond Head points are the place to look for any steeper, head‑high or better lines if wrap arrives late on the 17th. This spot benefits from angled NW wrap energy and intermediate periods; it will outperform the inner town breaks when the NW component strengthens. Best on low-to-mid tide with lighter winds.
- Outliers / exposed reef pockets
  - East‑ and SE‑facing reef pockets (Diamond Head side) are the primary beneficiaries of any late NW wrap. Expect scattered, steeper sets in those pockets rather than the broad, consistent surf that a true SSW pulse would produce.

5) Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowds, consistency
- Oct 15–16: Longboards, SUPs, and soft-tops dominate. Small, slow, chest‑to‑waistvil lines — ideal for longboard work and beginner/intermediate sessions. Shortboard users will find fewer usable steep sections; performance surfing limited to small, quick wedges.
- Oct 17: If the NW wrap materializes late as modeled, shortboard opportunities increase at exposed reef/point breaks (Diamond Head, some outliers). Otherwise, longboards still rule the lineups.
- Crowds: Small but consistent days draw more recreational surfers and tourists—expect busy lineups at Waikiki and Ala Moana morning and afternoon.

6) Tides & best windows
- Current station tide observations show low variability and a low around ~0.**3 ft** on Oct 13; apply normal diurnal tidal swings. In general:
  - Best windows: early mornings when trades are light and tide is filling—cleaner, longer rides at Waikiki/Ala Moana.
  - Diamond Head and exposed reef pockets: low-to-mid tide with lighter winds is optimal for any wrap-induced steeper lines (especially late on the 17th).

7) Confidence statement & data context
- Confidence: medium (0.64/1.00). Data coverage is strong (12/13 buoys, full chart / METAR / satellite / tides / tropical checks), so the assessment that the South Shore will be small and dominated by local/short-period energy is well supported. The main uncertainty is the degree to which the modeled Aleutian/Gulf Alaska energy (arriving Oct 17–18) refracts and produces usable wrap on south-facing reef pockets — that arrival window and resulting wrap angle account for most of the forecast spread.

Bottom line
Oct 15–16: small, slow south‑background — longboards and foamies, best in calm mornings. Oct 17: watch for an uptick late in the day as NW/Gulf-AK arrivals begin to wrap—Diamond Head and exposed reef pockets are the highest‑reward targets if that energy trends in; otherwise the shore stays in the small, longboardable regime. Trades will be the primary limiting factor for clean conditions.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: Large NW groundswell lingering — North Shore raw and dangerous (only for big-wave experienced), seek protected west/south options or wait for cleaner windows.

NORTH SHORE: Exposed NW points (Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa) — strong long-period NW groundswell (residual from the Oct 14 pulse) producing very large, powerful sets (head high to double‑overhead-plus on the line, heavy shorebreak); best window: early morning (first light → mid‑morning) before wind/wind‑swell and tide interaction junk the faces. Direction: NW/NNW.

SOUTH SHORE: Mostly protected from the NW energy — expect small to occasional chest‑high sets at the more sheltered reefs and inside sandbars; best window: mid‑day → afternoon for softer, more usable shapes at protected spots. Direction: minimal persistent SSE/NE energy; surf will be local and small.

EAST/WEST quick hits:
- East (Windward): Shorter-period NE/easter energy is present but will be blown out by E trades — choppy and onshore.
- West (Leeward/Ewa): East winds are offshore here (cleaner) — look for cleaner walls and more rideable waves at west-facing points, though size from the NW will be reduced vs. the North Shore.

WINDS: East ~080° at ~15–16 kt, gusting to ~23 kt (METAR PHNL 08016G23KT). Translation: trades will add wind‑swell and chop on north and east-facing breaks and tend to junk up long-period faces through the day; west-facing spots will run more offshore/clean. Expect gusts to increase midday — plan early for cleaner conditions on exposed breaks, or pick leeward exposures.

### Tides:
- Latest obs (NOAA 1612340): 2.**04 ft** at 2025-10-14 14:00 HST.
- Recent reference highs/lows (for context): High ≈ 2.**12 ft** (10/13 09:49 HST); Low ≈ 0.**30 ft** (10/13 18:06 HST).
- Action: current level ~**2 ft** — tide will materially affect wave shape at reef breaks; check local NOAA tide table for exact HST times before heading out.

ACTION ITEM: If you're experienced with big, heavy NW surf and shorebreak, go early (dawn → mid‑morning) and pick a safe, familiar lineup; if not, sit this one out or head to protected west/south reef breaks for cleaner, smaller waves. New NW pulses expected Fri–Sat (Oct 17–18) — conditions could build again; confidence medium (0.64).
