## Main Forecast

I’m ready to improve it, but I don’t have the actual forecast text yet. Please paste the forecast you’d like refined and I’ll tighten it up for accuracy, clarity, completeness, consistency, and specificity while preserving the original style and core information.

To tailor the edit, it helps if you can include:
- Local time zone and the forecast period (e.g., Today–Thu, Fri–Sun).
- All shores/spots you cover (regions like North Shore, South Shore, East Coast, etc.).
- Any model sources you rely on (e.g., GFS, ECMWF) or buoy notes.
- The original tone and formatting you want to keep (short-form, bullet style, etc.).

What I’ll deliver once I have the forecast text:
- Technical accuracy: verify swell heights, periods, and directions; ensure groundswell vs wind swell consistency; align with wind/tide windows.
- Clarity: easy-to-scan layout by region/shoreline and by day/time; clear units and minimal jargon.
- Completeness: cover all relevant shores and time periods; flag gaps or marginal spots.
- Consistency: uniform units, symbols, formatting; consistent timing conventions and swell directions relative to shore.
- Specificity: precise timing for peak conditions, wind windows (onshore/offsore), tidal influences, and spot-level notes.

If you’d like, I can also provide a ready-to-use improvement template you can paste your forecast into. Here’s a clean skeleton you can fill in (keeps the same style and structure you described, just with improved formatting):

- Period: [Local Date/Time Zone] – [Date/Time]

Region 1 — [Region/Shoreline]
- Today: [Swell 1] [height] ft @ [period] s from [direction]; [Swell 2] [height] ft @ [period] s from [direction] (if applicable)
  - Wind: [direction], [speed] [units], [onshore/offshore], window [start–end]
  - Tide: [high/low], [time], [height]
  - Conditions: [quality], [likely breaks or spots to watch]
- Tonight: [Swell details], [Wind], [Tide], [Notes]

Region 2 — [Another Region/Spot]
- [Day/Session] [Swell details], [Wind], [Tide], [Notes]

Spot-level notes (where relevant):
- [Spot name]: [specifics about peak times, wind shifts, beach/reef behavior, safety notes]

Tips for you to paste the forecast quickly:
- Use consistent abbreviations (e.g., NNW, SW for swell direction; WSW, NE for wind).
- Keep units consistent (feet or meters; seconds for period).
- Label days clearly (Today, Tonight, Tue AM, Tue PM, etc.) and include local time.
- Separate regions with headings and include a brief one-liner about overall conditions per region.

Whenever you’re ready, paste the forecast and I’ll produce the polished version right away.
