  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nA composite N / NNW pulse arrives early Monday morning (Oct 6) \u2014 multiple north components stack for solid north\u2011facing surf through Oct 6\u20137, easing by Oct 8. Smaller NW short\u2011period energy and a weak SSE component are present as background. ESE winds (~110\u00b0) will tend to push bump/chop on exposed faces; best windows are early mornings.\n\nDETAILS\nPrimary north energy (combined components)\n- N swell: 6.9 ft @ 11 s (direction ~350\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:50 HST.\n- N swell: 6.2 ft @ 12 s (direction ~350\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:50 HST.\n- N swell: 4.9 ft @ 11 s (direction ~350\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:56 HST.\n- N swell: 4.3 ft @ 12 s (direction ~350\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:26 HST.\nTiming/expectation: these N components arrive the morning of Oct 6 (09:25\u201310:00 HST window), produce the bulk of the energy through Oct 6 and into Oct 7 with peak sets early Oct 6\u20137, then progressively decay toward Oct 8 as the train passes.\n\nSecondary NNE / NNW / NW contributions\n- NNE: 6.9 ft @ 8 s (dir ~022\u00b0) and NNE: 6.6 ft @ 7 s (dir ~022\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:50 HST. These shorter\u2011period NNE pulses add punch and closeout potential at exposed reef sections, steepening sets.\n- NNW: 5.6 ft @ 11 s (dir ~338\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:56 HST.\n- NW: 3.3 ft @ 10 s (dir ~315\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:30 HST.\nNet effect: overlapping N / NNW / NNE trains create a peaky, irregular north swell with both long\u2011period push and shorter\u2011period punch \u2014 sizable sets, strong currents and occasional lulls between series.\n\nSSE (tropical/SE wrap)\n- SSE: 1.6 ft @ 13 s (dir ~157\u00b0) \u2014 arrival/peak 2025\u201110\u201106 09:30 HST.\nThis is a minor SSE component present as background; if the nearby tropical system holds/strengthens it can increase south/southeast energy later in the week, but for Oct 6\u20138 it remains small.\n\nWinds / weather\n- Reported wind vector 110\u00b0 (ESE). Expect ESE trades/flow to create sideshore to onshore texture on north exposures and onshore/cross on many south and east exposures during daylight hours. Morning offshore/cleaner windows likely limited; afternoon bump and chop develop as trades stabilize.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Size: Expect solid north\u2011facing conditions starting Oct 6 morning. Hawaiian\u2011scale: dominant components in the 4\u20137 ft Hawaiian range combine into frequent 8\u201312 ft+ faces at the most exposed points (Pipeline / Sunset / Haleiwa reef sectors) at peak of the train. Shorter\u2011period NNE pulses will steepen and close out some breaks \u2014 sets will be powerful and punchy.\n- Timing: arrival/initial peak 09:30\u201310:00 HST Oct 6, holding through Oct 7 mornings; noticeable decline through Oct 8.\n- Direction/period: primary energy from ~350\u00b0\u2013338\u00b0 (N\u2013NNW) with periods mainly 11\u201312 s plus shorter 7\u20138 s NNE pulses. Expect long, heavy sets mixed with faster, steeper pulses \u2014 bigger at Sunset/Pipeline where the longer period reads the reef.\n- Wind/quality: ESE winds (~110\u00b0) will produce side\u2011on to onshore conditions on the north shore, increasing surface texture and reducing hold at steeper reef breaks \u2014 best shots in the earliest daylight hours before trades fully strengthen. Strong currents and significant shorebreak/closeout risk at entrances and shore passes.\n- Spots: Pipeline \u2014 steep, heavy, frequent large sets; Sunset \u2014 long, powerful walls on peak sets; Haleiwa / Velzyland \u2014 punchy, powerful reef and rock sections, expect strong currents.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Size: South shore remains largely small for Oct 6\u20138. The SSE 1.6 ft @ 13 s component provides light background south energy (roughly 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian scale at most exposed south reefs). No large clean south pulse expected through Oct 8.\n- Timing/period: small SSE energy present starting early Oct 6 and continuing as background; periods around 13 s.\n- Wind/quality: ESE winds are cross\u2011onshore to onshore at many south exposures \u2014 expect lump and wind chop, especially midday. If trades back off briefly in early mornings some cleaner windows can appear, but overall south quality will be limited.\n- Spots: Diamond Head / Ala Moana may see small rideable longboard lines in the quieter early mornings; exposed reef points will remain underpowered.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond Oct 08)\n- Short term (through Oct 8): North swell energy decays through Oct 8 but remains above background on exposed north faces; conditions trend toward more lump and shorter\u2011period texture as the long\u2011period components fade. Expect continued ESE trade influence; best sessions early mornings.\n- Medium range (Oct 9\u201312): Pressure\u2011chart guidance and satellite analysis indicate additional NW energy possible later in the week as upstream mid\u2011latitude activity persists and a developing mid\u2011latitude storm (30\u201334N, 158\u2013162W) may augment NW components. Tropical Storm Octave remains a wild card \u2014 if it tightens and tracks WNW there is moderate potential for a stronger SSE/S swell later in the 4\u20137 day window.\n- Hazards: strong currents, powerful reef sets and poor visibility in choppy conditions; careful local judgment required on big north sets.\nOverall Forecast Confidence: 0.6/1.0 \u2014 high confidence that the north components arriving early Oct 6 will produce significant north shore surf; moderate confidence on exact peak faces and timing of any tropical SSE boost beyond Oct 8 (track/intensity dependent).",
  "north_shore": "North Shore \u2014 O\u2018ahu\nForecast period: 2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08\nFormat: Hawaiian-scale sizes (with practical face/ride notes), swell vectors & periods, wind/weather impacts, timing, and break-specific guidance. Technical focus with practical advice for surfers of all levels.\n\nSummary (big-picture)\n- Overall: A multi-pulse N/NNE-dominant pattern arrives 10/06 and organizes through 10/07, with the strongest window on 10/07 before energy slowly eases on 10/08. Expect a mix of longer 11\u201312s N energy (the main power source) overlapped by shorter, punchy NNE/NNE-leaning pulses in the 7\u20138s range and a smaller NW component. This produces solid North Shore surf \u2014 typically in the upper end of normal for early October and into the low-end of winter-scale energy.\n- Hawaiian-scale peak sizes: several pulses in the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian range (solid overhead+ faces at exposed reefs), with supporting 4\u20135 ft Hawaiian components. Combined, exposed reefs will see head-high to well overhead faces in the peak window; protected beaches and reef-sheltered inside points will be smaller.\n- Wind vector: 110\u00b0 (ESE) \u2014 directionally this is generally a side-off to offshore vector for exposed north-facing points on the North Shore. That favors cleaner outlines if winds remain light\u2013moderate. If 110\u00b0 strengthens into a fresher trade (>15 kt), expect texture and some chop on open-face lines but still better than onshore winds from the north or northwest.\n\nSwell breakdown (given inputs)\n(Notes: Hawaiian scale used as provided. Period/angle analysis below uses typical North Shore exposure ~345\u00b0\u2013010\u00b0 for true N, ~320\u00b0\u2013335\u00b0 for NW-to-NNW, and ~010\u00b0\u2013045\u00b0 for NNE.)\n- N \u2014 6.9 ft @ 11 s (moderate effect): Primary power source. Long enough to focus energy at exposed reef points (Pipeline, Backdoor, parts of Sunset) and to generate larger run-up at Waimea than shorter-period energy of the same Hawaiian number.\n- N \u2014 6.2 ft @ 12 s (moderate): Very efficient energy; 12s is high quality for North Shore reefs \u2014 will translate to good push and longer, cleaner faces when it aligns with the 11s pulse.\n- N \u2014 4.9\u20134.3 ft @ 11\u201312 s (moderate): Supporting background energy bringing consistent sets between the larger pulses.\n- NNW \u2014 5.6 ft @ 11 s (moderate): Adds angled energy that helps Sunset Beach and some northwestern-oriented points; will increase scale and grouping on the west end of the North Shore.\n- NW \u2014 3.3 ft @ 10 s (moderate): Smaller but helps with Sunset/lefts when combined with the N energy; not a primary driver.\n- NNE \u2014 6.9 ft @ 8 s and 6.6 ft @ 7 s (moderate): Shorter-period, punchy pulses from NNE. These will make the set interval closer and the waves steeper and less sweepy \u2014 more punchy close-outs and shorebreak tendency at exposed shallow reefs. They\u2019ll also crowd the energy spectrum and can produce congested, closeout-prone sets in places that rely on long-period energy.\n\nHow these combine (technical)\n- The 11\u201312s N pulses are the organizing energy: they refract onto the reef lines and produce the long, powerful, hollow rides that define Pipeline/Sunset/Waimea when they\u2019re working. Expect these to be the \u201cpush\u201d that dictates the larger set sizes and bigger run-up.\n- The NNE 7\u20138s pulses will arrive interleaved with the longer N energy. Shorter-period energy increases steepness and punch, so when a 7\u20138s pulse rides atop an 11\u201312s background you get very punchy sets \u2014 faster faces and a higher propensity for closeouts at some sections (particularly shallow reef takeoffs and beach entries).\n- The NNW/NW components will add directional spread: Sunset (which likes some northwest lift) and west-angled reef corners will get extra size/shape. Haleiwa reef/right points will see additional push on certain set directions.\n- Net effect: period grouping will be mixed; expect some powerful, well-formed long-period sets and frequent shorter, punchy pulses that can create unpredictable set spacing and steeper takeoffs.\n\nTiming (building \u2192 peak \u2192 dropping)\n- 10/06 (Mon): Building. The longer-period N 11\u201312 s pulses begin to arrive through the day (background energy lifting). Expect a steady increase in set size overnight; day conditions will trend from small/moderate in the morning to more consistent surf by evening. Shorter NNE pulses start to appear late in the day, increasing chop and closeout tendency on shallow reefs.\n- 10/07 (Tue): Peak window. Most energy lines combine \u2014 11\u201312s N swells overlapped with 7\u201311s pulses \u2014 between dawn and late afternoon. Peak average Hawaiian heights at exposed reefs: in the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian range during the main pulses. Midday \u2192 mid-afternoon is the most saturated window; sets will be most consistent then. If winds remain around 110\u00b0 and light, expect the cleanest outlines in morning to mid-day; if winds rise late morning \u2192 afternoon, face texture will increase.\n- 10/08 (Wed): Easing but still sizable. The longer-period N energy begins to decay; shorter-period NNE pulses may continue into the day, keeping some punch and closeout risk. Expect a gradual drop from the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian peak to mid-to-upper 4\u20136 ft Hawaiian by late 10/08.\n\nWind, weather and practical impact (given 110\u00b0 direction; speed unknown)\n- Directional effect: 110\u00b0 (ESE) is generally side-off to offshore for exposed north-facing reefs and points on the North Shore. That will tend to clean wave faces and hold the lip for hollow rides (good for pipeline/backdoor) if winds are light.\n- If 110\u00b0 is light (<10 kt): excellent outlines, very surfable, cleaner barrels and better defined sets at reefs.\n- If 110\u00b0 is moderate (10\u201318 kt): still a generally favorable vector but expect more surface texture and wind chop on exposed lines; sandier beachbreaks will get roughed up; offshore push can groom barrels early in the swell window.\n- If 110\u00b0 is strong (>18 kt): expect significant texture, spray out of lips, and increased steering on takeoffs; short-period pulses will be harder to handle; shorebreaks and rip strength increase \u2014 more difficult and dangerous for less experienced surfers.\n- Other weather: no wind speed provided. Monitor local buoys and cams; if a trade-wind surge or a localized easterly convergence occurs, conditions can deteriorate quickly for face quality despite offshore orientation.\n\nBreak-specific notes (practical guidance, times, and expected faces; Hawaiian scale used)\nGeneral note: \u201cHawaiian\u201d sizes below convert to expected face ranges and rideability. Conditions will vary strongly with tide and local wind strength.\n\nPipeline / Backdoor (Ehukai reef)\n- Expected scale: peak pulses push into the 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian range at the most exposed sections during the main window (10/07 mid \u2192 afternoon). That translates to consistent overhead to multiple-overhead faces on the reef when the 11\u201312s energy lines up.\n- Shape: With the 11\u201312s N energy and the offshore-side 110\u00b0 vector, expect hollow, fast, barreling sections on the inside reefs. The 7\u20138s NNE pulses will increase steepness and speed, producing very punchy, critical barrels \u2014 but also greater closeout risk and unpredictable set intervals.\n- Best timing: mid to late morning through mid-afternoon 10/07 for the peak; early 10/07 AM may be slightly cleaner if winds are lighter.\n- Skill note: Very heavy. Only expert/pro-level surfers. Lifeguards/spot check recommended for set handling and entry/exit. Strong rips and powerful shorebreak.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Expected scale: combined N + NNW energy gives Sunset good size \u2014 expect 6 ft Hawaiian peaks on the bigger sets during 10/07, with many sets in the 4\u20136 ft Hawaiian range.\n- Shape: Sunset will respond well to the NW/NNW vector; the NNE short-period pulses will add punch and can make the inside sections close out on the steepest sets. On the whole, Sunset should have long, rideable open-face sets from the 11\u201312s N energy, and heavier, punchier takeoffs with the 7\u20138s energy.\n- Best timing: mid to late morning into afternoon 10/07. Low-to-mid tides often make Sunset more bridgeable; mid-tide windows could be prime \u2014 check local tide boards.\n- Skill note: Advanced surfers only on larger pulses. Intermediates can find more forgiving peaks when sets are smaller or at the more protected shoulders.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Expected scale: Waimea is sensitive to run-up \u2014 with multiple 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian pulses at 11\u201312s on 10/07, expect significant sets; Waimea will see overhead-plus to very large, heavy shore-pounding waves on the biggest sets (guy lines can get steep). Still not classic giant winter 15+ ft Hawaiian stuff, but serious.\n- Shape/behavior: The 11\u201312s N energy will give Waimea long, powerful runs; the shorter-period NNE pulses will steepen takeoffs and increase shorebreak. Currents and backwash will be strong; paddle in/out will be hazardous during peak.\n- Best timing: peak mid-morning \u2192 mid-afternoon 10/07; mid to high tide windows often help Waimea breathe \u2014 watch the tide.\n- Skill note: Big wave proficiency required on peak sets. If you\u2019re not comfortable with strong shorebreak and heavy wipeouts, sit this one out. Lifeguard presence and local knowledge strongly advised.\n\nHaleiwa / Three Tables / Pua\u2018ena / Chun\u2019s Reef\n- Expected scale: reef and beachbreaks in the Haleiwa sector will see 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian-sized windows depending on exposure; Haleiwa Reef & Pua\u2018ena will be head-high to over-head on the larger sets during the 10/07 peak (4\u20136 ft Hawaiian typical).\n- Shape: These spots will see mixed conditions \u2014 some long open-face rides on the N 11\u201312s, punchier inside sections when the 7\u20138s pulses arrive. Rocky sections like Chuns will get heavier and more hollow; inside beach peaks may close out more frequently.\n- Best timing: morning to mid-day 10/07; smaller, more manageable conditions at other times for intermediates.\n- Skill note: A range of options from advanced reef/point lines to more forgiving beachbreak peaks; pick a protected peak if unsure.\n\nTurtle Bay / Right-hand corners\n- Expected scale: more sheltered corners will see 3\u20135 ft Hawaiian on the peak swell \u2014 rideable but with occasional larger sets.\n- Shape: often more manageable; good option for advanced-intermediates wanting size without full North Shore exposure.\n- Timing: consistent through the peak 10/07 afternoon; cleaner under light 110\u00b0 winds.\n\nTide & local variability\n- Because many North Shore reefs are tide-sensitive, timing relative to local tides will modulate peak performance: Pipeline and Backdoor favor mid to higher tide when the reefs can breathe cleanly with 11\u201312s energy; Sunset often benefits from a mid-tide; Waimea\u2019s run-up is amplified on rising/higher tides \u2014 check the daily tide table for exact windows.\n- Short-period NNE energy will make shallow late-low tides more contact-heavy and increase closeouts; if the main peak coincides with low tide on 10/07 expect more blowouts on the shallowest sections.\n\nRip/current and safety considerations\n- Combined pulse patterns, especially with mixed periods, produce strong rips and variable set intervals. Entrances and exits will be more hazardous than usual on peak days.\n- Shorebreak and backwash will be amplified on the smaller beaches and shallower reef shelves when 7\u20138s NNE energy dominates a segment.\n- Recommend: leash, local spot checks, surf with partners, and avoid unfamiliar exit spots during the 10/07 peak.\n\nWho should go\n- Experts/professional surfers: Pipeline, Backdoor, Sunset, Waimea on the 10/07 peak \u2014 expect hollow, fast, heavy waves.\n- Advanced-intermediate: Seek more protected reef corners, Turtle Bay rights, and select Haleiwa peaks during lower/shoulder windows (early AM or after peak).\n- Beginners/early-intermediate: Sit out peak 10/07; better days will be the build day (10/06 morning) if sizes are still modest, or wait until the swell decays on 10/08.\n\nComparison to recent and seasonal norms\n- Seasonal context: Fall on the North Shore is a transition toward winter\u2019s NW-N swell train. Typical fall NW\u2013WNW swells run 2\u20136+ ft Hawaiian; the pattern this forecast depicts (multiple 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian pulses, with efficient 11\u201312s energy) sits at the upper end of historical early-October norms and is consistent with the ramp-up toward winter.\n- Recent conditions: If the days prior to 10/06 were relatively quiet (typical of an early fall lull), this pattern represents a clear increase in energy and consistency \u2014 the first real north pulses of the season that resemble winter hints. If you\u2019ve seen modest surf recently, plan for a noticeable jump in both size and power on 10/07.\n\nBottom line & tactical plan\n- 10/06: surf builds through the day; best for those wanting a progressive warm-up into bigger conditions. Check tide windows; morning surf will be smaller/cleaner.\n- 10/07: prime and critical window \u2014 peak energy with 11\u201312s N pulses overlapped by 7\u20138s NNE pulses. Expect head-high to well overhead reefs; Pipeline, Sunset, and Waimea all will be active and heavy. Offshore-side 110\u00b0 will help face quality if winds remain light; if wind strengthens, expect increased surface texture and harder paddles.\n- 10/08: energy tapers but remains elevated compared to pre-event; still sizeable with punchy sets. Safer, more forgiving sessions in the afternoon as the long-period energy decays.\n\nFinal notes\n- Monitor local wind speeds (110\u00b0 vector is favorable directionally but speed matters). Use cams and buoy reports to refine timing with tide.\n- Expect mixed-period set rhythms \u2014 patience is required; many strong sets will be followed by quieter windows. Choose your lineup and entry points conservatively.\n- Safety first: Pipeline/Backdoor/Waimea are serious at these sizes \u2014 local knowledge and wave judgment essential.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce a tide-tied hourly window for each break (needs location-specific tide times), or\n- Convert Hawaiian-scale numbers to approximate face heights in feet/meters for each spot, or\n- Plot an estimated set-interval and ideal entry times based on local tide tables.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore \u2014 O\u2018ahu\nForecast window: 2025\u201110\u201106 through 2025\u201110\u201108\n\nQuick summary\n- Primary energy: SSE swell, 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) at 13 s \u2014 a modest, moderate\u2011period south pulse. On the Hawaiian scale this is a solid knee\u2011to\u2011head option on most town breaks (roughly 3\u20133.5 ft face when it lines up).\n- Wind: from 110\u00b0 (ESE). That vector will tend to be side\u2011on/off\u2011shore for a few east\u2011facing nooks but more side\u2011on/onshore for the majority of south\u2011facing town breaks \u2014 expect texture, especially through the afternoon sea\u2011breeze window if winds strengthen.\n- Overall: surfable, clean in the early mornings if winds are light; afternoons will likely show more bump. Best days/times: early mornings and tide windows that favor exposed sandbars and reefs.\n\nSwell analysis (technical)\n- Given: SSE (roughly 155\u2013160\u00b0) at 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) and 13 s period. Period is moderate \u2014 enough energy to produce well\u2011formed faces on reef and point features and to push through shallow sandbars at Waikiki/Ala Moana.\n- Energy/ride potential: Hawaiian 1.6 ft converts to about 3.2 ft face in open faces as a rule of thumb (Hawaiian \u2248 half face height). With a 13 s period that energy is relatively punchy for the size \u2014 it will create usable peaks rather than mush, and will favor faster, more critical lines at points and reef pockets.\n- Directional effects: SSE is a touch more easterly than the canonical fall S\u2013SSW direction. That means:\n  - East\u2011facing and open south\u2011east exposures (sections just east of Diamond Head, parts of Waikiki toward Kapiolani Park end) will see the best direct energy.\n  - Spots that like SSW energy may be slightly shadowed or less punchy than on a pure SSW swell of equal size/period.\n- Ground swell vs wind swell: 13 s is in the ground\u2011swell range for local breaking; expect cleaner, longer intervals between sets than a short, wind\u2011chop swell of similar height.\n\nTiming (how this pulse evolves: 6 \u2192 8 Oct)\n- 2025\u201110\u201106: Swell already present at start of the period. Expect building/overtone energy early that settles into a steadier arrival by late morning. If the swell arrived overnight, plan for the size to be near peak on this day.\n- 2025\u201110\u201107: Peak or holding day. Most consistent lines, best windows in the early AM. If winds remain ESE and strengthen through the day, expect cleaner surf before sunrise and increasing texture through midday/afternoon.\n- 2025\u201110\u201108: Gradual decline. Energy fades \u2014 sets become less consistent and interval tightens; small leftover knee\u2011to\u2011waist high lines remain on the better sandbars and reefs.\n\nWind and weather effects (South Shore specifics)\n- Wind from 110\u00b0 (ESE): for most south\u2011facing town breaks this is a side\u2011on to side\u2011onshore vector \u2014 it will add chop and close out the most wind\u2011sensitive peaks during onshore setup (midday sea breeze).\n- Local timing: typical diurnal pattern still applies \u2014 lighter winds pre\u2011dawn/early morning, sea breeze picks up late morning into afternoon. If winds are light in the morning, expect clean, groomed faces; if ESE winds are already steady/strong, look for texture, onshore pockmarks, and less defined lips.\n- Weather note: without speed information, assume at least a light ESE component that will make early\u2011AM windows the cleanest opportunity.\n- Current and tide interaction: on the South Shore, many sandbars and reef bowls are tide\u2011sensitive. Lower to mid tides typically give tighter, punchier peaks at Pops/Queens and Ala Moana Bowls; higher tides favor long, mellow walls at Canoes and Waikiki longboarders.\n\nBreak\u2011specific guidance (town breaks and notable spots)\nNote: all Hawaiian heights shown in Hawaiian scale; face estimates are approximate.\n\nWaikiki overview (Canoes, Duke\u2019s/Fort, Queens, Pops, Kaimana)\n- General: SSE 13 s will put usable, rideable energy into the whole Waikiki line. Expect longboarders to find more glassy walls early; high\u2011performance surfers should look to Pops and Queens for the more critical sections.\n- Canoes (longboard line): Hawaiian ~1.5\u20131.8 ft range expected \u2014 translates to long, forgiving walls. Best early morning if winds are light; rides will be long and cruisy. High tide favors longer rides here.\n- Duke\u2019s / Fort area: A mix of open face and occasional punchy sections; with 13 s period you\u2019ll get some push off the reef. Mid\u2011tide is a sweet spot for shape; afternoon onshore can make it a bit soft.\n- Queens: Will show the most defined shoulders and occasional steeper sections. Expect some punch on the inside shoulders with longer lines during the peak day (10/07). If ESE winds strengthen, Queens can get a little bumpy.\n- Pops: Steeper, punchier pocketing sections here \u2014 this break will have the best shortboard action when sets line up. Low to mid tides sharpen the pocket; watch for quick takeoffs.\n- Kaimana / Fort east\u2011end: Slightly more exposed to SSE energy than the central Waikiki reef \u2014 can see a little more size and punch, especially early in the swell when direction is SSE.\n\nAla Moana (Bowls, Small Boat Harbor/Outer Reefs)\n- Ala Moana Bowls: Responds well to the 13 s energy \u2014 expect punchy, hollow inside peaks at low\u2011to\u2011mid tide on the peak day. Bowls are wind\u2011sensitive; mornings best if ESE winds freshen.\n- Ala Moana outside reef / Small Boat Harbor corner: Will see a cleaner push with the SSE angle; easier takeoffs, but currents and channel flow can be tricky on bigger pulses. The outer reef will show the most shape and speed.\n- Magic Island / Kewalo: Much like the rest of the harbor exposures \u2014 punchy when sets stack, but tide and local currents can make ride lengths variable.\n\nOther notable town\u2011adjacent exposures\n- Diamond Head east side / Kapi\u2018olani area: Slightly more exposed to SSE \u2014 can pick up extra energy and feel a touch bigger/steeper than central Waikiki. Good for faster, more critical turns when sets run.\n- Kahala / residential east points: Will see some energy from the SSE and can produce clean, lined up waves in the early morning if winds stay ESE but light.\n\nWho should go and what to expect\n- Longboarders / cruisers: Good windows in the early morning and on higher tides at Canoes and central Waikiki. Expect long walls and easy paddleouts.\n- Shortboarders / performance: Best looking, most critical waves at Pops, Queens and Ala Moana Bowls on the peak day (10/07) \u2014 expect faster faces and usable pockets on the steeper sections.\n- Beginners: Small days and mellow peaks will be available at protected spots (Canoes, parts of Ala Moana) \u2014 morning sessions preferred before any sea breeze picks up.\n\nComparison: recent vs. normal (seasonal)\n- Seasonal norm (Fall South Shore): Typical fall pattern runs S to SSW with sizes commonly in the Hawaiian 1\u20133 ft range and decreasing activity as the south season winds down. Periods are generally in the mid\u2011teens when there are organized ground swells.\n- This pulse (SSE, 1.6 ft @ 13 s) is within the normal fall size range \u2014 essentially middle of the pack for fall \u2014 but the slightly more easterly direction (SSE vs S\u2013SSW) alters which town breaks pick up the best energy.\n- Compared to the immediate recent trend (a few smaller, fading south swells are typical at the tail end of the season), this swell is a modest reinforcement \u2014 not a major storm\u2011driven pulse, but a useful, surfable fill\u2011in with enough period to produce quality faces on reefs and well\u2011formed sandbars.\n\nPractical tips and hazards\n- Morning sessions will generally be cleaner and more organized; plan sessions pre\u201110 AM if ESE winds back the faces later.\n- Watch currents near the Ala Moana channel and Kewalo Harbor \u2014 SSE pushes can enhance side currents on some tide phases.\n- If you\u2019re chasing critical pocket sections, focus on low\u2011to\u2011mid tide windows at Pops/Queens and Ala Moana Bowls, but be ready for quicker, steeper ramps; longboarders should favor higher tides and the Canoes lineup.\n- Because the swell is slightly more easterly than typical SSW fall energy, check exposures east of Diamond Head for a little extra size and punch.\n\nBottom line\nExpect a modest, rideable south pulse through 10/06\u201310/07, peaking around the 7th with the cleanest conditions early in the day. SSE direction favors east\u2011tilted exposures and gives Waikiki and Ala Moana usable, punchy lines at low\u2011mid tide. ESE winds (110\u00b0) are the wildcard \u2014 if light, mornings will be excellent; if they strengthen into a sea breeze, afternoons will see texture and shorter, less tidy faces.",
  "daily": "Quick note: I don\u2019t have live buoy/wind/tide reads for 2025-10-06, so below is a practical, surfer-focused forecast based on a north (N) swell hitting Oahu \u2014 written to be actionable if a moderate-to-solid N swell (most common scenario) was expected that day. Check local buoys, cams and tide charts before heading out.\n\n1) Summary \u2014 today (2025-10-06)\n- A dominant N swell is lighting up the North Shore. Best conditions early when winds are light; expect cleaner lines in the morning and on incoming tide, with trades or NE wind building through the day and increasing surface chop by midday/afternoon.\n- Skill split: big/drifty on reef peaks (Pipeline/Sunset/Waimea) \u2014 expert-only at larger sizes. Fun, rideable sets at Hale\u02bbiwa/other protected points for intermediates if swell stays moderate.\n\n2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale) \u2014 approximate and converted to face heights\n- North Shore: Hawaiian 3\u20135 ft (face \u2248 6\u201310 ft). Expect powerful reef peaks; bigger at the bigger spots (Ehukai/Pipeline, Waimea).\n- Northeast-facing points (e.g., Turtle Bay area, some East-O\u02bbahu points): Hawaiian 1\u20132 ft (face \u2248 2\u20134 ft). Cleaner when swell angles a little east.\n- South Shore (Waikiki/Ala Moana): Hawaiian 0\u20131 ft (face \u2248 0\u20132 ft). Very small or sheltered \u2014 best for beginners/longboarding if you want something mellow.\n- West Shore (Ewa/Barbers, Makaha): Hawaiian 0\u20132 ft (face \u2248 0\u20134 ft), depending on swell wrap and tide; Makaha can pick up some size if the swell is very long period.\n\n(Quick note: Hawaiian scale is colloquial \u2014 roughly half the actual face height. I included face estimates to help choose spots and board size.)\n\n3) Wind & weather\n- Best window: early morning (dawn to mid-morning) with light variable to light offshore winds at many North Shore exposures \u2014 cleanest surf then.\n- Midday to afternoon: typical NE trade winds pick up (expect 10\u201318+ kt), turning cross/offshore on some east corners and cross/onshore at exposed north reefs \u2014 this will add chop and close out some sections.\n- Showers possible with typical tropical/late-summer trade flow; brief rain showers can reduce visibility and make currents stronger.\n\n4) Tides \u2014 surf relevance\n- Reef breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea): perform differently by tide \u2014 mid to slightly dropping tide often produces the hollowest sections at Pipeline; Waimea typically needs a medium/high to get big, punchy sets. If in doubt, aim for the mid-tide window for most north reefs.\n- Beach breaks and points (Hale\u02bbiwa, Pupukea) often work best from mid-to-low depending on sand. Waikiki/shorebreaks favor higher tides for mellow banks.\n- Action: check the local tide chart for exact high/low times; plan to be on the water 1\u20132 hours before the favorable tide window and prioritize the morning low-wind slot.\n\n5) Best spots for today (actionable picks)\n- For experts (heavy, hollow, high consequence): Ehukai (Banzai/Pipeline), Sunset \u2014 expect heavy, fast reef barrels if the swell gets large. Bring a tow or big-wave experience at Waimea if it\u2019s pumping.\n- For intermediates/advanced: Hale\u02bbiwa (and the Pupukea complex) \u2014 more forgiving peaks and points that hold swell and offer longer rides when the swell is moderate.\n- For all-levels/longboarders: If the N swell is modest, some protected points on the north/east corners (smaller sections of Hale\u02bbiwa) or head to Waikiki/Ala Moana for consistent, mellow lines \u2014 especially as north swell wraps less to the south shore.\n- For small-swell sessions or families: Waikiki \u2014 sheltered and forgiving; good backup if north swell is large and dangerous on the reefs.\n\n6) Changing conditions through the day\n- Early morning: cleanest, best window. Hit the water at dawn to catch the most organized sets and lighter wind.\n- Late morning \u2192 afternoon: trades (NE) building, making exposed north reefs choppier/cross-shore. Smaller surf on points and beach breaks may get wind-blown; surf will tend to close out in spots that favor offshore in light winds.\n- Evening: wind may drop slightly after sunset; swell energy may ease slowly overnight depending on swell period/consistency.\n\nSafety & final tips\n- If it looks overhead+ on the head-high face scale (Hawaiian 4\u20135), treat it like a serious reef/big-wave day \u2014 local knowledge and experience required.\n- Check local buoy (NOAA/NDBC), NWS marine, and surf cam feeds for exact swell period and size before paddling out.\n- Plan to surf the morning low-wind window; scout spots from shore and watch sets for size, current, and hold-down risk.\n\nIf you want, I can pull specific buoy/wind/tide numbers and a minute-by-minute tide chart for 2025-10-06 if you tell me which data source or buoy/camera you prefer (e.g., NOAA buoy 51001, Windy, Surfline cam).",
