### Summary
- Dominant energy: long‑period NW/NNW field observed on regional buoys (H1/3 to ~**16 ft** offshore at 14 s). That offshore pulse is already present but will refract and arrive more coherently at exposed North/NW Oʻahu reefs late Friday → Saturday (peak Saturday 10/18 per propagation runs).
- Timing: buoy/physics arrivals point to first large arrivals Saturday 10/18 — Aleutian/Gulf of Alaska propagation picks show energy reaching Hawaii 10/18–10/19 (Aleutian: 10/18 10:39 HST; Gulf‑AK: 10/18 13:40 HST; follow‑on pulses 10/19).
- Winds/tide snapshot: light trades now — PHNL METAR 161153Z 08005KT (E at 5 kt). NOAA tide station 1612340 latest obs 1.**78 ft**. Overall forecast confidence 0.7/1.0 (data confidence 0.68).

### Details
- Long‑period NW/NNW (14 s): multiple buoy detections show large offshore H1/3 energy (16.**4 ft** @ 324°, 15.**1 ft** @ 331°, 13.**8 ft** @ 304°). These are the principal swell-makers for the North Shore once refracted/filtered by the island chain. Propagation models place the energy arrival and peak for exposed North/NW breaks on 10/18 (Aleutian model arrival 10/18 10:39 HST; Gulf‑AK arrival 10/18 13:40 HST). Monitor NDBC buoys 51001 / 51002 / 51003 for real‑time confirmation; local reef amplification and H1/10 set faces will be substantially higher (see H1/10 ests: **17–22 ft** offshore → large sets at exposed headlands).
- Short‑period ESE (8 s): buoy reports show an energetic short‑period component (15.**1 ft** H1/3 at 8 s). This is trade/windswell energy — it lights up east‑exposures and inside breaks on diurnal timing. Expect more variability with seabreezes.
- SW / SSW (15 s): a 9.**2 ft** @15 s component is present offshore and satellite shows a subtropical convective fetch south/southwest of the islands — this is the seed of a S/SSW groundswell that models and imagery project to arrive/strengthen in ~3–5 days (watch late 10/18 → 10/20 for increases on south/southwest exposures).
- West / mid‑period (13 s): smaller 7.**2 ft** W energy will act as a filler, broadening the set distribution on reefy west exposures.
- Exposure & island effects: subtropical high east of Hawaii will modulate NE trade flow and refract easterly energy; north‑western refraction and island shadowing mean exposed points/reef will take most of the set energy while some bays/sheltered spots remain notably smaller. Exact onshore heights depend on local bathymetry and refraction — exposure weights for the buoy detections are not available in the ingest.

### North Shore (OʻAhu)
- Oct 16–17: Expect small → moderate residual N/NNW energy with choppy to blended conditions on open north points. Mornings cleaner; trades light now (PHNL 08005KT) but typical seabreeze/afternoon onshore will develop. Practical H1/3 at most north exposures: small to chest‑shoulder on sets (local climo/early‑season transition); H1/10 set faces limited but watch for unexpected larger sets on exposed headlands because offshore buoys already show large NW energy.
- Late Oct 17 → 10/18: Model propagation and buoy matches point to a clear increase into a solid long‑period NW groundswell. Expect H1/3 on exposed North Shore breaks to move into the high‑single digits to low‑teens ft H1/3 on the peak (pressure‑chart/swell‑zone guidance suggests H1/3 **8–12 ft** on exposed north reefs; H1/10 set faces **16–22 ft** possible at the most exposed locations). Confidence on exact peak timing and spot heights: moderate (0.68) — island refraction and decay will redistribute energy.
- Safety note: be conservative at unfamiliar reefs; sets will be long‑running and powerful when the 14+ s energy arrives.

### South Shore (OʻAhu)
- Oct 16–18: Generally small. Short‑period ESE windswell (8 s) will keep some inside and east‑facing reef breaks rideable, especially mornings; expect low chest‑to‑head high sets at best on the prime south reefs. The SW 15 s component is present offshore but model/satellite guidance keeps the main S/SSW groundswell arrival outside the immediate 48‑hour window — build expected 3–5 days after 10/16.
- When the S/SSW groundswell arrives (tentative 10/18–10/20): exposed south/southwest reef and point breaks will see a noticeable jump — H1/3 estimates offshore **3–6 ft** translate to H1/10 set faces roughly **6–12 ft** on the most exposed reefs if the subtropical convective fetch holds together. Confidence: lower than for the NW event (satellite/convective evolution is the key uncertainty).
- Tides/conditions: current tide observations (NOAA 1612340) show near‑low heights at the time of last read; check NOAA tide tables for specific windowing — many south reef breaks favor mid‑to‑high tide on larger groundswell days.

OUTLOOK (beyond 10/18)
- Short term (10/18–10/19): Primary long‑period NW arrival — expect peak north/NW surf across exposed Oʻahu north points. Follow‑on pulses from the Aleutian/Dateline gales may sustain elevated north energy into 10/19–10/20. Physics‑based arrival table: Aleutian pulse 10/18 10:39 HST (**6 ft** @ 18 s offshore), Gulf‑AK 10/18 13:40 HST (**5 ft** @ 13 s), and secondary Aleutian pulses 10/19 (**4 ft** @ 14 s and **4 ft** @ 13 s) — these will broaden and extend the event.
- Medium term (10/19–10/21): Expect NW to slowly ease; S/SSW groundswell from subtropical convective complex may fill in for south/southwest exposures if the convection remains coherent (satellite projects 3–5 day build). Trades likely remain active — east exposures will trend onshore in afternoons.
- Tropical cue: Central Pacific Tropical Outlook shows no tropical cyclone development in the 7‑day window. No direct tropical threat to Oʻahu in the next week.
- Monitoring checklist: verify real‑time buoy reads on 51001/51002/51003 for swell height/period evolution, check PHFO NWS updates, and watch local coastal buoys and WW3 spectra to refine H1/3 → H1/10 translation and exact peak timing.

### Data Limitations & Confidence
- Confidence in the ingest: 0.68/1.00 (medium). Exposure weights for the listed buoy detections are not available in the digest; that increases spot‑level uncertainty. Satellite and pressure charts align on a strong NW source and a developing subtropical S/SSW source — timing and peak heights hinge on storm evolution and cross‑basin decay. Use buoys 51001/51002/51003 and PHNL METAR for live checks.

## North Shore Forecast

Dominant swell: A very large NW–NNW pulse is in — buoy data show a dominant NW 16.**4 ft** H1/3 (estimated H1/10 ≈ 21.**3 ft**) at 14 s arriving around 01:20 HST on Oct 16, reinforced by a 15.**1 ft** NNW component (14 s). Exposure-weighting on the primary NW pulse is high (0.98/0.90), so expect sustained, powerful north-to-northwest energy through the window.

Wind / tide interplay: Surface winds are light E (~080° at ~5 kt in the latest METAR), which is generally light enough to keep many north-facing reefs reasonably clean — expect sideshore to somewhat offshore components at sheltered orientations in the morning. A daytime thermal sea breeze can develop and veer winds more onshore into the afternoon, degrading hold and increasing chop. Tide is low–mid at the observation time (~1.**8 ft**) with the main pulse arriving very early; as the day progresses into a rising tide the shallow reef sections will load up and push waves harder onto the flats, increasing wash-through and shore pounding. Small changes in wind timing or local tide phasing will materially change how each reef behaves — moderate uncertainty there.

Flagship break guidance (faces quoted relative to buoy H1/3 and estimated H1/10 where useful):
- Pipeline / Ehukai: Extremely heavy. With the NW/NNW 14 s energy and high exposure weighting expect long, very powerful reef sets — H1/3 around the mid-teens (≈**16 ft** H1/3) with larger H1/10 pulses (~**21 ft**). Expect fast, hollow, frequently closing-out barrels and significant shore dump. Only for experienced big-wave crews; impact and hold-down risk is very high.
- Sunset Beach: One of the more lineal, rideable exposures to this angle. Faces will be very large — expect big, punchy **15–25 ft** faces (H1/3 → H1/10 range), long running walls when the sets line up, but also heavy closeouts. W-to-NW secondary energy will also stiffen the line-up, producing long, powerful sets; cleaner in the morning with light E winds.
- Waimea Bay: Giant, raw energy. Expect extremely large, heavy shorebreak and focused lines — faces routinely exceeding the H1/10 estimate at the prime moments because of local bathymetric focusing. Breaks will be extremely hazardous with massive wash-through and strong rip/ebb currents; only proven big-wave teams and tow/swell-ready crews.
- Haleiwa / Chuns Reef: Exposed and punchy on the peaks — expect heavy, overhead-plus surf with powerful takes and big closeouts. Slightly more forgiving on the long-period Ns/NNW component but still hazardous.
(Choose channels / line-ups only if you have big-wave experience and proper support.)

Hazards: These swell levels place many north and northwest reefs squarely in the local high-surf advisory/warning regime — expect life‑threatening shorebreak, strong rip currents, heavy wash-throughs and increased risk of equipment loss. Beaches and exposed shoreline will see significant run-up; swimming or casual beach activity is strongly discouraged. If you are not part of a trained, equipped big-wave team do not enter the water.

Near-term evolution / additional pulses: Model/storm tracking shows additional long-period energy arriving later in the weekend — an Aleutian **6 ft** @ 18 s pulse and a Gulf Alaska **5 ft** @ 13 s pulse are projected to arrive Saturday Oct 18 (10:39 AM and 01:40 PM HST respectively), with another Aleutian pair later (Oct 19). These have moderate confidence (70–75%) and could refresh or prolong large north/northwest exposure into the weekend.

Confidence and key caveats: Medium confidence overall (data coverage is good: 14/17 buoys reporting; global confidence 0.68). Primary NW pulse has strong buoy evidence and high exposure weights (0.98/0.90) — confidence in the presence of very large north‑west energy is high. Uncertainty is moderate for exact peak timing at individual reefs, the degree of local focusing that will amplify faces at Waimea/Pipeline, and the timing/strength of secondary pulses and daytime sea breezes. Use local camera/watch reports and harbor advisories as the event unfolds.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore forecast — Thu Oct 16 → Sat Oct 18 (confident, data‑backed)

Bottom line
- Expect small, rideable south‑side surf through the window with most energy coming from short‑period ESE windswell and a modest background SW pulse. Peaks will be punchy and localized — Diamond Head and Ala Moana will be the best bets for steeper, rideable waves; Waikiki will see the cleaner, softer lines that favor longboards when the tide sets up.
- Local winds light E/ENE (~5 kt) this morning and generally light through the period — favorable for cleaner south shore conditions at town reefs. Overall confidence medium (see data note at end).

1) Opening assessment (size, direction, timing)
- Dominant contributors for the South Shore this period:
  - ESE short‑period windswell (source data: ESE 15.**1 ft** H1/3 @ 8 s, exposure weight 0.50). This is the main local driver for town reefs — fast, punchy energy.
  - Background southern‑hemi/SW pulse (SW 9.**2 ft** H1/3 @ 15 s). Lower frequency energy that will add some shape and occasional longer sets at exposed SW‑facing outliers.
  - Minor W/SSE components present but secondary for true south exposures.
- Local estimated sizes (Hawaiian scale):
  - Thu Oct 16 — South Shore aggregate: H1/3 roughly 1.5–2.**5 ft**; H1/10 roughly 2.5–4.**0 ft**. ESE windswell dominant (short period, punchy), with a small amount of SW background.
  - Fri Oct 17 — Small bump possible as southern pulse nudges up: H1/3 ~2.0–3.**0 ft**; H1/10 ~3.0–4.**5 ft** at the most exposed bends/points.
  - Sat Oct 18 — Trend toward similar or slowly easing values; H1/3 ~1.5–2.**5 ft**; H1/10 ~2.5–4.**0 ft**. Note: north Pacific arrivals (Aleutian/Gulf Alaska energy arriving late Oct 18–19) are NW and will largely bypass the south side — minor wrap effects only at the most exposed outliers.

2) Town reefs vs outliers — specifics and tide/wind nuance
- Diamond Head sector
  - Best target for punch and peak sets. The short‑period ESE energy (8 s) will throw fast, hollow faces here — expect chest to head high+ (H1/3 peaks toward upper end of the ranges on Thu/Fri).
  - Winds: light E/ENE (≈5 kt) is generally sideshore to slightly offshore for parts of Diamond Head in the morning — favorable for cleaner faces. Afternoon sea‑breeze tendencies could nudge onshore; check local forecast if planning later sessions.
  - Tides: mid to slightly higher tides help hold the face and maintain a connected takeoff. Low tides can make the wave quicker and punchier but more critical.
- Waikiki (including Kapiʻolani / Outrigger breaks)
  - Cleaner, longer rides when the ESE energy is present but lower in period; waves more mellow than Diamond Head. Best for longboarders and prone surfers at the lower end of the size range.
  - Mid‑tide window gives the best balance of ride length and speed; incoming tide will often fatten lines for longer noserides.
  - Light E winds favor cleaner mornings; expect more editing/bumps in the afternoon with any sea breeze.
- Ala Moana / Harbor inside breaks
  - Small, punchy, and often the most crowded when town swell is small. Works on mid‑to‑high tide when the harbor setup provides quick inside peaks — great for shortboard work and quick re‑entries.
  - Because of harbor geometry, the short 8 s ESE energy can produce steep, fast waves here that reward timing.
- Outliers / exposed SW points
  - The longer 15 s SW pulse will show up primarily on more exposed S/SW points and reefs — these locations could see the most organized sets, but overall energy is modest.
  - Where shoreline orientation allows wrap/refraction around headlands, expect slightly cleaner, longer sets than in the town spots. Timing for the background pulse favors Fri into Sat for the crest of that component.

3) Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd/consistency expectations
- Longboards: best mornings at Waikiki and gentle sections — consistent small‑swell rides, especially Thu and Sat when the ESE windswell is weaker. If you want long, forgiving lines, early sessions are your best bet.
- Shortboards: Diamond Head and Ala Moana will offer the punch and steepness that shortboards want — particularly on the ESE windswell and during the Fri bump from the SW pulse.
- Consistency & crowds: inconsistent sets — pockets of rideable surf interspersed with lull — so expect moderate crowds in town reefs. When the punchy sets arrive, crowds compress quickly; outliers will be less crowded but less consistent.

4) Wrap potential & background southern hemi pulses — practical implications
- Wrap: The island geometry generally blocks most NW energy from reaching the South Shore. The ESE short‑period windswell and any E‑to‑SE energy have direct line of sight to town reefs and will be the principal producers. Longer period SW energy (15 s) will refract/wrap into selected S/SW facing reefs and points — this is why you’ll see occasional longer, cleaner sets at exposed outliers even when town reefs are only marginal.
- Southern hemi pulses: present but modest. Expect the background SW 15 s component to give the best returns on Fri into Sat at exposed south/southwest bends; it will not overwhelm the short‑period ESE signal but will add occasional longer runners and better shape to some peaks.

Physics‑based arrivals note
- Long‑range NW energy (Aleutian/Gulf Alaska arrivals predicted for Oct 18–19) is aimed NW; modelled arrivals are real but are not favorably oriented for the South Shore. Expect negligible direct increase to town south surf — only small wrap or lump possible at the most exposed SW/West outliers late Oct 18 into Oct 19.

Tide & wind snapshot
- Latest observed tide ~1.**78 ft** (obs 01:54 HST). Recent highs/lows show a small tidal range through the period. Mid‑tide to slightly high is generally preferred at Ala Moana; Waikiki performs well mid to low depending on sand levels.
- Winds: METAR PHNL 08005KT — light E/ENE today and generally light through the forecast window. That favors cleaner early sessions on the south side; monitor afternoon sea breeze development.

Confidence / data quality
- Overall confidence: medium. Global confidence metric 0.68/1.00; data collectors mostly successful (buoy coverage 14/17, charts/models/satellites good). South Shore quality index 0.41 — signals are real but mixed (strong short‑period local energy mixed with modest background long‑period pulses and partial exposure weighting). Timing of the ESE windswell is well supported by local buoy/wind data; the magnitude of the SW southern‑hemi bump into Fri is moderately confident but could vary as swell energy refracts around the island chain.

Final practical guidance
- If you want punch and shortboard action — aim for Diamond Head and Ala Moana, especially mornings when winds are light. If you want long, clean rides and fewer critical sections — early Waikiki sessions on mid‑tide are your go‑to. Keep an eye on the Fri window for the best organized sets from the SW pulse; otherwise expect small, fun, but somewhat inconsistent south‑side surf through Sat.

If you want, I can pull a site‑by‑site H1/3 & H1/10 table (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head, selected outliers) with exact expected ranges and best tide/wind windows.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: North Shore running very large 14‑s NW energy — only seasoned big‑wave crews; Makaha/West looks like the cleanest, most rideable option for experienced regular surfers this morning.

NORTH SHORE: Faces — Ehukai/Pipeline → Sunset → Haleiwa; Direction — NW/NNW (324–331°), long period 14s; Size — buoy H1/3 ~**16 ft** (H1/10 ~**21 ft**) — giant, powerful sets; Best window — now through mid‑morning while winds stay light (first light → ~midday). Hazard note — extreme hold‑downs, heavy shorebreak, fast currents; tow teams or highly experienced big‑wave surfers only.

SOUTH SHORE: Faces — Waikiki/Ala Moana; Direction — ESE (113°), short period ~8s; Size/feel — buoy shows short‑period energy but expect punchy, choppy beachbreaks rather than long rides (local surf will be much smaller than north numbers suggest). Best window — small/cleaner windows only if winds drop; otherwise bumpy.

### East/West Quick Hits:
- East: SSE energy small (≈**5 ft** @14s) — minimal for most east points.
- West: W/13s background swell (~**7 ft** H1/3) + light E winds = Makaha/Kaena could be the most surfable, cleaner option for experienced surfers this morning.

WINDS: METAR PHNL 080° @ 5 kt (light east). Practical effect — sideshore/offshore for many North Shore breaks (favors form and glassiness); onshore for south exposures (adds bump/chop); offshore for west side (cleans Makaha). Expect best surface quality in the morning while winds remain light (confidence: medium).

### Tides:
- Current reading: 1.**78 ft** at 01:54 HST (NOAA 1612340).
- Recent low: ~0.**20 ft** (Oct 15 ~19:06 HST). Check local tide table for today’s exact high/low times before you go — tide will determine which North Shore spots peel vs. close out.

ACTION ITEM: If you’re not big‑wave trained and supported, sit this one out or head to Makaha mid/late morning while winds stay light; if you are a big‑wave crew with support/rescue, prime window is now → mid‑morning — expect very large, dangerous sets and strong currents. (Overall data confidence: medium.)
