Several NNW/NW components (7\u20137.5 ft H1/3, 15\u201317s) are concurrent and reinforcing.  \n- Winds: light ENE trades observed ~070\u00b0 at ~6 kt (PHNL METAR 140753Z), so winds are light and will generally not wreck north swell quality \u2014 but local variability matters.  \n- Confidence: 0.7/1.0 overall. Key data gap \u2014 buoy IDs/time series for specific fetch-to\u2011Hawaii verification are not embedded in the digest (see DETAILS).\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary long\u2011period NW swell (315\u00b0 / 16.7s / 8.5 ft H1/3 \u2192 ~11.1 ft H1/10): window centered 2025\u201110\u201113 21:56 HST in the digest. Source flagged as buoy_spectral; matches pressure/satellite analysis showing a robust WNP extratropical low with long fetch aimed toward Hawaii. Expect larger, well\u2011spaced sets, strong currents, and heavy impact on exposed north and northwest points. (Buoy source recorded as \"buoy_spectral\" in digest; specific NDBC buoy IDs unavailable \u2014 verify with NDBC buoys along 160E\u2192180\u2192150W great circle and local Hawaiian buoys before fielding.)  \n- Reinforcing NNW/NW energy (7.5 ft H1/3 @ 15\u201317s): multiple spectral entries (328\u00b0, 341\u00b0, 318\u00b0) cluster around the same window; these add directional spread and longer runup on exposed reefs. They are likely from a combination of the central\u2011NPAC gale and the western NPAC storm complex seen on the charts. Source tags: generic \"buoy\" / \"buoy_spectral\" in digest.  \n- Smaller NW components (304\u00b0 / 3.9 ft @ 17s) and northerly traces (N / 3.6 ft @ 16.7s): will fill in directional variability and can make some point breaks peak/overlap \u2014 expect inconsistent sets but still substantial power at exposed reef/Pipeline lineups.  \n- Southern/southeast background (SSE 168\u00b0 / 2.0 ft @ 13s): minimal for the south shore \u2014 fun background groundswell but not a primary driver.  \n- Tidal context: NOAA tide station 1612340 latest obs 1.34 ft at 2025\u201110\u201113 22:30 HST; full local tide tables needed for prime peaks \u2014 the digest tide times are limited to prior-day highs/lows, so check updated NOAA tide tables for specific spot timing.\n\nBuoy / data note: digest lists 12/13 buoys successful and multiple spectral/buoy-derived swell components, but specific buoy IDs for the swell spectra are not included. That is a material data gap for exact arrival confirmation; operational users should pull NDBC buoy time series and WaveWatch III point data for final confirmation before paddling.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- General: Expect sizable, long\u2011period NW swell through Mon night (10/13) into Tue (10/14), with sets capable of 10\u201315 ft faces on the most exposed reefs/points when H1/3 ~7\u20139 ft and H1/10 estimates ~10\u201313+ ft. Pipeline, Sunset, Ehukai and Haleiwa will see the brunt.  \n- Winds: light ENE trades ~6 kt near PHNL \u2014 generally favorable for early\u2011morning north faces (light sideshore to light onshore depending on location). Trade gusts or local gusty bands can make shoulder/chop on exposed points. METAR PHNL 140753Z shows 07006KT; use local buoy wind obs for spot timing.  \n- Hazards & surfability: heavy currents, fast\u2011moving long sets, and shorebreak at exposed beach entries. If the 16\u201317s components arrive as indicated, reef setups (Pipe, Outside Sunset) will be raw and best for experienced surfers only. Confidence in north swell timing/size moderate (0.7) \u2014 verify with local buoy spectra.  \n- Tactical: incoming long\u2011period energy favors highest\u2011profile reef breaks; mid\u2011tide to higher tide windows will steepen faces on reefs \u2014 but check exact tide times for each break.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- General: South is quiet to small across the 13\u201315 Oct window. Digest shows only a minor SSE component (2.0 ft H1/3 @13s) \u2014 surf mostly background, waist\u2011to\u2011chest on favourable beach breaks. Fall climatology: south season winding down \u2014 this matches expectation.  \n- Winds: E/ENE trades produce short\u2011period chop and small windswell on east\u2011facing southern points. With trades light, some clean windows possible but nothing large.  \n- Tactical: good days for longboarders and less\u2011experienced riders at protected south beaches; not a north\u2011swell threat zone this window. Confidence lower for any rapid south increase (0.6) \u2014 southern hemi activity appears weak in satellite imagery.\n\nOUTLOOK (extend 1\u20133 days beyond 10/13\u201310/15)\n- Short term (10/14\u201310/15): NW/NNW energy should remain elevated into Tue 10/14 with gradual directional variability as central\u2011NPAC gales relax \u2014 expect lingering 7\u20139 ft H1/3 energy on the north shore early in the window, easing through 10/15. Local trade winds likely persist light to moderate; east shores see short\u2011period windswell.  \n- Near term arrival (10/16 and beyond): a Kamchatka\u2011sourced prediction in the digest projects 6 ft @ 20s arriving Thu 10/16 12:51 PM HST (travel time ~2.6 days; confidence ~75%). If that arrives as forecast it will inject another long\u2011period NW pulse and could raise H1/3 and set\u2011faces again, particularly on NW exposures. This aligns with the pressure\u2011chart signal of a robust WNP storm capable of producing multiple long\u2011period arrivals over several days. Expect overlay/interference patterns (crossing seas) and potential amplification at focal points.  \n- Tropical note: Central Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook shows no tropical cyclone formation expected next 7 days \u2014 no TC contribution to swell in this window.  \n- Recommended checks: pull NDBC/NOAA buoy time series for open\u2011ocean buoys along the 160E\u2192180\u2192150W corridor and local Hawaiian buoys for continuous confirmation of period/height (period is the biggest control on surf face; long\u2011period energy will drive the big sets). The pressure charts and satellite both indicate additional long\u2011period NW energy is probable within 4\u20137 days \u2014 monitor evolution.\n\nFinal operational point\n- Current digest and chart/satellite analysis paint a classic early\u2011fall North Shore push: long\u2011period NW energy is dominant now (10/13) and another long\u2010period node (Kamchatka 20s pulse) may arrive ~10/16 to re\u2011energize north exposures. Buoy ID/time series for the swell spectra are not embedded in the digest \u2014 verify with live NDBC buoy spectra and WaveWatch III output before final spot calls. Tidal station cited in digest: NOAA 1612340 (latest obs 1.34 ft @ 22:30 HST).\n\n\u2014 Pat \u201cSwellCaldWell\u201d Caldwell, Surf News Network.",
  "north_shore": "Dominant swell: a strong NW pulse \u2014 buoy reads ~8.5 ft H1/3 (\u224811.1 ft H1/10 est) at ~16.7 s peaking in the window around 21:56 HST on Oct 13 \u2014 with strong supporting NNW/NW energy in the 15\u201317 s band that will keep the North Shore lively through the 13th and into the 14th.\n\nWind / tide interplay (short version): wind is light ENE (\u2248070\u00b0 at ~6 kt in the latest METAR), which is essentially sideshore to offshore for the primary North Shore exposures and should help keep faces relatively clean during the peak periods. That light ENE is a gift with this NW/NNW energy \u2014 it will accentuate hollow, fast faces rather than mush them out. Tidal state is modest (latest water level ~1.34 ft at 22:30 HST); with these long-period swells the biggest, most critical sets will come on mid to rising tide at reef and point exposures \u2014 when the long-period energy hits shallow reefs you\u2019ll see the biggest step-up and punch. Check your local tide table for exact high/low timing before paddling; mid/high will be the most hazardous times for impact-zone wash-through.\n\nFlagship break notes (what to expect \u2014 read these and match skill to conditions):\n- Pipeline (Ehukai) \u2014 expect long-period 16\u201317 s NW/NNW energy to produce fast, steep, and very hollow peaks. Faces will be powerful; occasional 1\u20132+ overhead barrels on the peak sets, with very little forgiveness on the inside. Offshore ENE winds should help the barrels hold but don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 only very experienced big-wave tube riders and spotters. Exposure weight for the main NW pulse is high (~0.91\u20130.95), so this is a solid, direct energy source.\n- Sunset Beach \u2014 long, heavy momentum on the 15\u201317 s band; expect powerful, lined-up sets that wind up into long rides or heavy closeouts depending on precise refraction. Big pushy takeoffs and long walls where the sand lines up; again, conditions will be raw and physical \u2014 keep an eye on transfer/shorebreak on the inside.\n- Waimea Bay \u2014 with the estimated H1/10 near ~11 ft the bay will see very large, forceful sets. Waimea responds strongly to the long-period NW/NNW trains \u2014 expect heavy paddle and tow sets, significant shorewash, and big currents. This is big-water surfing; if you\u2019re not max-confident, sit this one out.\n- (Short callout) Haleiwa / Chun\u2019s \u2014 more wind- and tide-dependent but expect solid overhead+ sets at exposed points; cleaner in the morning with the light ENE.\n\nHazards: this energy sits at or just below many seasonal High Surf Advisory thresholds for the North Shore (H1/10 ~11 ft estimated). That means hazardous shorebreaks, strong rip currents, wash-throughs over reef flats, and heavy impact zones at the main breaks \u2014 serious consequence for wipeouts. If you plan to surf, use flotation, have spotters, and respect watercraft/tow safety protocols. Lifeguard advisories and beach closures are possible if heights verify or if local bathymetry combines to produce larger-than-expected faces.\n\nConfidence and uncertainties: overall data coverage is good (12 of 13 buoys online, charts/sat/tides successful); global confidence is moderate (0.69/1.0) and the North Shore quality index here is roughly 0.56. I\u2019m confident the NW 16\u201317 s train will be the dominant driver and that exposed NW/NNW breaks will feel it strongly (exposure weights for the main NW/NNW drivers are high ~0.91\u20130.95). Uncertainty is moderate around the exact peak set timing at individual breaks and the relative contribution of the several similar-direction components (some NNW 17 s pieces have lower weights ~0.50), so expect variability by beach and tide. Also watch for the next Kamchatka pulse (model/track suggests 6 ft @ 20 s arriving ~Oct 16 at ~12:51 PM HST, 75% confidence) that could refresh or amplify the long-period background after the 15th.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast \u2014 Oct 13 \u2192 Oct 15, 2025\nConfidence: medium (0.69). Data basis: 12/13 buoys, full chart/satellite/tide/metar coverage. Forecast focuses on actual SSE energy measured at the South Shore plus the strong northern-hemisphere background that can \u201cwrap\u201d into exposed town reefs.\n\n1) Opening assessment \u2014 size, direction, timing\n- Primary South energy: SSE ~2.0 ft H1/3 (\u22482.6 ft H1/10) at ~13 s \u2014 measured window around Oct 13 evening (21:30 HST). That is the only direct south component of note for the period; expect small, slow south-swell lines through Oct 13\u201315.\n- Background/wrap risk: Large long-period NW/NNW energy is dominant offshore (multiple buoy reports centered 15\u201317 s; strongest analysis ~8.5 ft H1/3 \u2248 11.1 ft H1/10 at ~16.7 s). That energy will be the controlling factor for overall sea state offshore and can refract/diffract into south-facing, less-sheltered reefs \u2014 especially during the NW peaks late Oct 13 into Oct 14. Expect the overall sea to be confused: small true south sets interlaced with longer, infrequent, steeper NW sets where local bathymetry allows wrap.\n- Timing: Small SSE component is present now and holds through Oct 15 but stays in the 2 ft H1/3 class. The long-period NW energy is already in the water column (Oct 13) and should be strongest through Oct 13\u201314 before gradually fading into Oct 15. A separate longer-period storm from Kamchatka is modeled to arrive after our window (Oct 16).\n\n2) Town vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head) \u2014 tides & winds\n- Winds: latest METAR 070\u00b0 at 6 kt (light ENE). Expect light trades (E\u2013ENE) through the window \u2014 generally under 10 kt. That wind vector gives a mild quartering onshore for true south exposures (creates a touch of bump at many South Shore spots) but is light enough that mornings should be reasonably clean.\n- Tides: tidal range is modest; latest obs ~1.3 ft (Oct 13 late). With small south energy, tide will modulate shape more than size \u2014 mid to higher tides will soften reef breaks; lowest tides tend to focus energy on shallow reefs.\n- Ala Moana (Bowls/Harbor): well protected from NW. With the measured SSE ~2 ft you\u2019ll see knee-to-waist high, most consistent midtide. Ala Moana tends to be mushy on small periods; expect mellow rides good for longboard cruising and small-board practice. Wraped NW energy is unlikely to materially increase size here.\n- Waikiki (Canoes/Queens/Pops): small SSE at ~13 s is the ticket \u2014 longboard/open-face rides on the peak sets. Light ENE winds make it rideable early; bump builds later day. Waikiki will be the consistent, forgiving option for most surfers over the three days.\n- Diamond Head / Paddlers & Reef points east of Waikiki: most likely to register any NW wrap. Because these points have more exposure and reef contours that can refract long-period NW energy, expect occasional bigger, steeper sets late Oct 13 into Oct 14 (chest\u2013head high+ on the face at times if refraction lines up). These larger sets will be inconsistent and accompanied by mixed-period confusion; they favor shortboard maneuvering when they occur.\n- Outliers (east point reefs / Sandy\u2019s / Kaimana stretch): respond best to true SSE/S windswell \u2014 with only ~2 ft H1/3 they\u2019ll be small but clean for longboarders at low to mid tide. Outliers that are more exposed to NW will show the wrap-enhanced sets described above.\n\n3) Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd & consistency expectations\n- Longboards: best play across the period. The measured SSE 13 s energy (2 ft H1/3) produces slow, softer lines ideal for noseriding \u2014 Waikiki and Ala Moana will be the most consistent longboard options. Expect long, mellow rides during the better windows.\n- Shortboards: will see payoff if/when the NW long-period sets refract into exposed reef zones (mainly Diamond Head and some east reefs). Those sets will be steeper and faster but inconsistent and generally interspersed with small, messy south-swell lines. Shortboard sessions will be more hit-or-miss and require patience.\n- Crowds/consistency: Overall small, mellow south-swell \u2192 lower-to-moderate crowds at main town breaks (Waikiki/Ala Moana). Diamond Head and the exposed outliers will attract small numbers of experienced surfers willing to sit through lulls for the occasional better NW-wrapped set.\n\n4) Wrap potential & physics note\n- Wrap is the key story. Deep-water analysis shows substantial long-period NW energy (15\u201317 s, H1/3 7\u20138.5 ft; H1/10 up to ~11 ft). Islands and reef geometry will refract/diffract a portion of that energy into south-facing reefs. Expect the wrap to be:\n  - Most effective at reef points with clear refractive corridors (Diamond Head, some east-side reef passes).\n  - Moderately effective elsewhere \u2014 Ala Moana and most of Waikiki will remain dominated by the direct SSE 2 ft component and are largely protected from the full NW pulse.\n  - Intermittent in timing \u2014 long-period NW sets will come in low frequency (long intervals), produce steeper faces when they do, then lapse back to the small SSE rhythm.\n- Practical expectations: where wrap lines build, faces can run chest\u2013head+ at peak sets (H1/3 estimates 3\u20135 ft locally); where protected, expect the measured SSE ~2 ft H1/3 (\u22482.6 ft H1/10) with long, soft faces.\n- Physics-based outlook: a separate far-northern storm (modeled Kamchatka event) is projected to arrive Oct 16 (6 ft @ 20 s), which could amplify northwest energy after our 3-day window \u2014 keep an eye on Friday for a more organized northern pulse.\n\nConfidence statement and data completeness\n- Confidence: medium (0.69). Buoy coverage strong (12/13), charts/satellite/tides/METAR all available and consistent. The main uncertainty is how much of the large NW energy will refract into specific south reef corridors \u2014 local bathymetry and small-angle refraction create spotty, high-variance outcomes. Expect clean, small south conditions for longboarders in town; expect occasional, steeper NW-wrapped sets at exposed reefs with higher shortboard potential but more inconsistency.\n\nBottom line: Friday\u2013Sunday (Oct 13\u201315) is a mellow South Shore window overall \u2014 best for longboards and cruisy sessions (Waikiki, Ala Moana). Keep an eye on Diamond Head and east reef passes for intermittent long-period NW sets that will be steeper and faster; those are higher-skill, lower-frequency opportunities. Watch for increased NW energy after Oct 15 with the modeled Kamchatka arrival on Oct 16.",
