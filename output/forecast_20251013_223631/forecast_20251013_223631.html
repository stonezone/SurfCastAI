<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dominant swell: long‑period NW energy (H1/3 ~8.<strong>5 ft</strong>; estimated biggest sets ~<strong>11 ft</strong> face) peaking on the evening of Mon 10/13 HST. Several NNW/NW components (7–7.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/3, <strong>15–17s</strong>) are concurrent and reinforcing.  </li>
<li>Winds: light ENE trades observed ~070° at ~6 kt (PHNL METAR 140753Z), so winds are light and will generally not wreck north swell quality — but local variability matters.  </li>
<li>Confidence: 0.7/1.0 overall. Key data gap — buoy IDs/time series for specific fetch-to‑Hawaii verification are not embedded in the digest (see DETAILS).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Primary long‑period NW swell (315° / 16.7s / 8.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/3 → ~11.<strong>1 ft</strong> H1/10): window centered 2025‑10‑13 21:56 HST in the digest. Source flagged as buoy_spectral; matches pressure/satellite analysis showing a robust WNP extratropical low with long fetch aimed toward Hawaii. Expect larger, well‑spaced sets, strong currents, and heavy impact on exposed north and northwest points. (Buoy source recorded as "buoy_spectral" in digest; specific NDBC buoy IDs unavailable — verify with NDBC buoys along 160E→180→150W great circle and local Hawaiian buoys before fielding.)  </li>
<li>Reinforcing NNW/NW energy (7.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/3 @ <strong>15–17s</strong>): multiple spectral entries (328°, 341°, 318°) cluster around the same window; these add directional spread and longer runup on exposed reefs. They are likely from a combination of the central‑NPAC gale and the western NPAC storm complex seen on the charts. Source tags: generic "buoy" / "buoy_spectral" in digest.  </li>
<li>Smaller NW components (304° / 3.<strong>9 ft</strong> @ 17s) and northerly traces (N / 3.<strong>6 ft</strong> @ 16.7s): will fill in directional variability and can make some point breaks peak/overlap — expect inconsistent sets but still substantial power at exposed reef/Pipeline lineups.  </li>
<li>Southern/southeast background (SSE 168° / 2.<strong>0 ft</strong> @ 13s): minimal for the south shore — fun background groundswell but not a primary driver.  </li>
<li>Tidal context: NOAA tide station 1612340 latest obs 1.<strong>34 ft</strong> at 2025‑10‑13 22:30 HST; full local tide tables needed for prime peaks — the digest tide times are limited to prior-day highs/lows, so check updated NOAA tide tables for specific spot timing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buoy / data note: digest lists 12/13 buoys successful and multiple spectral/buoy-derived swell components, but specific buoy IDs for the swell spectra are not included. That is a material data gap for exact arrival confirmation; operational users should pull NDBC buoy time series and WaveWatch III point data for final confirmation before paddling.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE (Oahu)
- General: Expect sizable, long‑period NW swell through Mon night (10/13) into Tue (10/14), with sets capable of <strong>10–15 ft</strong> faces on the most exposed reefs/points when H1/3 ~<strong>7–9 ft</strong> and H1/10 estimates ~10–13+ ft. Pipeline, Sunset, Ehukai and Haleiwa will see the brunt.<br />
- Winds: light ENE trades ~6 kt near PHNL — generally favorable for early‑morning north faces (light sideshore to light onshore depending on location). Trade gusts or local gusty bands can make shoulder/chop on exposed points. METAR PHNL 140753Z shows 07006KT; use local buoy wind obs for spot timing.<br />
- Hazards &amp; surfability: heavy currents, fast‑moving long sets, and shorebreak at exposed beach entries. If the <strong>16–17s</strong> components arrive as indicated, reef setups (Pipe, Outside Sunset) will be raw and best for experienced surfers only. Confidence in north swell timing/size moderate (0.7) — verify with local buoy spectra.<br />
- Tactical: incoming long‑period energy favors highest‑profile reef breaks; mid‑tide to higher tide windows will steepen faces on reefs — but check exact tide times for each break.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE (Oahu)
- General: South is quiet to small across the 13–15 Oct window. Digest shows only a minor SSE component (2.<strong>0 ft</strong> H1/3 @13s) — surf mostly background, waist‑to‑chest on favourable beach breaks. Fall climatology: south season winding down — this matches expectation.<br />
- Winds: E/ENE trades produce short‑period chop and small windswell on east‑facing southern points. With trades light, some clean windows possible but nothing large.<br />
- Tactical: good days for longboarders and less‑experienced riders at protected south beaches; not a north‑swell threat zone this window. Confidence lower for any rapid south increase (0.6) — southern hemi activity appears weak in satellite imagery.</p>
<p>OUTLOOK (extend 1–3 days beyond 10/13–10/15)
- Short term (10/14–10/15): NW/NNW energy should remain elevated into Tue 10/14 with gradual directional variability as central‑NPAC gales relax — expect lingering <strong>7–9 ft</strong> H1/3 energy on the north shore early in the window, easing through 10/15. Local trade winds likely persist light to moderate; east shores see short‑period windswell.<br />
- Near term arrival (10/16 and beyond): a Kamchatka‑sourced prediction in the digest projects <strong>6 ft</strong> @ 20s arriving Thu 10/16 12:51 PM HST (travel time ~2.6 days; confidence ~75%). If that arrives as forecast it will inject another long‑period NW pulse and could raise H1/3 and set‑faces again, particularly on NW exposures. This aligns with the pressure‑chart signal of a robust WNP storm capable of producing multiple long‑period arrivals over several days. Expect overlay/interference patterns (crossing seas) and potential amplification at focal points.<br />
- Tropical note: Central Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook shows no tropical cyclone formation expected next 7 days — no TC contribution to swell in this window.<br />
- Recommended checks: pull NDBC/NOAA buoy time series for open‑ocean buoys along the 160E→180→150W corridor and local Hawaiian buoys for continuous confirmation of period/height (period is the biggest control on surf face; long‑period energy will drive the big sets). The pressure charts and satellite both indicate additional long‑period NW energy is probable within 4–7 days — monitor evolution.</p>
<p>Final operational point
- Current digest and chart/satellite analysis paint a classic early‑fall North Shore push: long‑period NW energy is dominant now (10/13) and another long‐period node (Kamchatka 20s pulse) may arrive ~10/16 to re‑energize north exposures. Buoy ID/time series for the swell spectra are not embedded in the digest — verify with live NDBC buoy spectra and WaveWatch III output before final spot calls. Tidal station cited in digest: NOAA 1612340 (latest obs 1.<strong>34 ft</strong> @ 22:30 HST).</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Dominant swell: a strong NW pulse — buoy reads ~8.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/3 (≈11.<strong>1 ft</strong> H1/10 est) at ~16.7 s peaking in the window around 21:56 HST on Oct 13 — with strong supporting NNW/NW energy in the <strong>15–17 s</strong> band that will keep the North Shore lively through the 13th and into the 14th.</p>
<p>Wind / tide interplay (short version): wind is light ENE (≈070° at ~6 kt in the latest METAR), which is essentially sideshore to offshore for the primary North Shore exposures and should help keep faces relatively clean during the peak periods. That light ENE is a gift with this NW/NNW energy — it will accentuate hollow, fast faces rather than mush them out. Tidal state is modest (latest water level ~1.<strong>34 ft</strong> at 22:30 HST); with these long-period swells the biggest, most critical sets will come on mid to rising tide at reef and point exposures — when the long-period energy hits shallow reefs you’ll see the biggest step-up and punch. Check your local tide table for exact high/low timing before paddling; mid/high will be the most hazardous times for impact-zone wash-through.</p>
<p>Flagship break notes (what to expect — read these and match skill to conditions):
- Pipeline (Ehukai) — expect long-period <strong>16–17 s</strong> NW/NNW energy to produce fast, steep, and very hollow peaks. Faces will be powerful; occasional 1–2+ overhead barrels on the peak sets, with very little forgiveness on the inside. Offshore ENE winds should help the barrels hold but don’t be fooled — only very experienced big-wave tube riders and spotters. Exposure weight for the main NW pulse is high (~0.91–0.95), so this is a solid, direct energy source.
- Sunset Beach — long, heavy momentum on the <strong>15–17 s</strong> band; expect powerful, lined-up sets that wind up into long rides or heavy closeouts depending on precise refraction. Big pushy takeoffs and long walls where the sand lines up; again, conditions will be raw and physical — keep an eye on transfer/shorebreak on the inside.
- Waimea Bay — with the estimated H1/10 near ~<strong>11 ft</strong> the bay will see very large, forceful sets. Waimea responds strongly to the long-period NW/NNW trains — expect heavy paddle and tow sets, significant shorewash, and big currents. This is big-water surfing; if you’re not max-confident, sit this one out.
- (Short callout) Haleiwa / Chun’s — more wind- and tide-dependent but expect solid overhead+ sets at exposed points; cleaner in the morning with the light ENE.</p>
<p>Hazards: this energy sits at or just below many seasonal High Surf Advisory thresholds for the North Shore (H1/10 ~<strong>11 ft</strong> estimated). That means hazardous shorebreaks, strong rip currents, wash-throughs over reef flats, and heavy impact zones at the main breaks — serious consequence for wipeouts. If you plan to surf, use flotation, have spotters, and respect watercraft/tow safety protocols. Lifeguard advisories and beach closures are possible if heights verify or if local bathymetry combines to produce larger-than-expected faces.</p>
<p>Confidence and uncertainties: overall data coverage is good (12 of 13 buoys online, charts/sat/tides successful); global confidence is moderate (0.69/1.0) and the North Shore quality index here is roughly 0.56. I’m confident the NW <strong>16–17 s</strong> train will be the dominant driver and that exposed NW/NNW breaks will feel it strongly (exposure weights for the main NW/NNW drivers are high ~0.91–0.95). Uncertainty is moderate around the exact peak set timing at individual breaks and the relative contribution of the several similar-direction components (some NNW 17 s pieces have lower weights ~0.50), so expect variability by beach and tide. Also watch for the next Kamchatka pulse (model/track suggests <strong>6 ft</strong> @ 20 s arriving ~Oct 16 at ~12:51 PM HST, 75% confidence) that could refresh or amplify the long-period background after the 15th.</p>

        <div class="forecast-section shore-forecast">
            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>South Shore forecast — Oct 13 → Oct 15, 2025
Confidence: medium (0.69). Data basis: 12/13 buoys, full chart/satellite/tide/metar coverage. Forecast focuses on actual SSE energy measured at the South Shore plus the strong northern-hemisphere background that can “wrap” into exposed town reefs.</p>
<p>1) Opening assessment — size, direction, timing
- Primary South energy: SSE ~2.<strong>0 ft</strong> H1/3 (≈2.<strong>6 ft</strong> H1/10) at ~13 s — measured window around Oct 13 evening (21:30 HST). That is the only direct south component of note for the period; expect small, slow south-swell lines through Oct 13–15.
- Background/wrap risk: Large long-period NW/NNW energy is dominant offshore (multiple buoy reports centered <strong>15–17 s</strong>; strongest analysis ~8.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/3 ≈ 11.<strong>1 ft</strong> H1/10 at ~16.7 s). That energy will be the controlling factor for overall sea state offshore and can refract/diffract into south-facing, less-sheltered reefs — especially during the NW peaks late Oct 13 into Oct 14. Expect the overall sea to be confused: small true south sets interlaced with longer, infrequent, steeper NW sets where local bathymetry allows wrap.
- Timing: Small SSE component is present now and holds through Oct 15 but stays in the <strong>2 ft</strong> H1/3 class. The long-period NW energy is already in the water column (Oct 13) and should be strongest through Oct 13–14 before gradually fading into Oct 15. A separate longer-period storm from Kamchatka is modeled to arrive after our window (Oct 16).</p>
<p>2) Town vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head) — tides &amp; winds
- Winds: latest METAR 070° at 6 kt (light ENE). Expect light trades (E–ENE) through the window — generally under 10 kt. That wind vector gives a mild quartering onshore for true south exposures (creates a touch of bump at many South Shore spots) but is light enough that mornings should be reasonably clean.
- Tides: tidal range is modest; latest obs ~1.<strong>3 ft</strong> (Oct 13 late). With small south energy, tide will modulate shape more than size — mid to higher tides will soften reef breaks; lowest tides tend to focus energy on shallow reefs.
- Ala Moana (Bowls/Harbor): well protected from NW. With the measured SSE ~<strong>2 ft</strong> you’ll see knee-to-waist high, most consistent midtide. Ala Moana tends to be mushy on small periods; expect mellow rides good for longboard cruising and small-board practice. Wraped NW energy is unlikely to materially increase size here.
- Waikiki (Canoes/Queens/Pops): small SSE at ~13 s is the ticket — longboard/open-face rides on the peak sets. Light ENE winds make it rideable early; bump builds later day. Waikiki will be the consistent, forgiving option for most surfers over the three days.
- Diamond Head / Paddlers &amp; Reef points east of Waikiki: most likely to register any NW wrap. Because these points have more exposure and reef contours that can refract long-period NW energy, expect occasional bigger, steeper sets late Oct 13 into Oct 14 (chest–head high+ on the face at times if refraction lines up). These larger sets will be inconsistent and accompanied by mixed-period confusion; they favor shortboard maneuvering when they occur.
- Outliers (east point reefs / Sandy’s / Kaimana stretch): respond best to true SSE/S windswell — with only ~<strong>2 ft</strong> H1/3 they’ll be small but clean for longboarders at low to mid tide. Outliers that are more exposed to NW will show the wrap-enhanced sets described above.</p>
<p>3) Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd &amp; consistency expectations
- Longboards: best play across the period. The measured SSE 13 s energy (<strong>2 ft</strong> H1/3) produces slow, softer lines ideal for noseriding — Waikiki and Ala Moana will be the most consistent longboard options. Expect long, mellow rides during the better windows.
- Shortboards: will see payoff if/when the NW long-period sets refract into exposed reef zones (mainly Diamond Head and some east reefs). Those sets will be steeper and faster but inconsistent and generally interspersed with small, messy south-swell lines. Shortboard sessions will be more hit-or-miss and require patience.
- Crowds/consistency: Overall small, mellow south-swell → lower-to-moderate crowds at main town breaks (Waikiki/Ala Moana). Diamond Head and the exposed outliers will attract small numbers of experienced surfers willing to sit through lulls for the occasional better NW-wrapped set.</p>
<p>4) Wrap potential &amp; physics note
- Wrap is the key story. Deep-water analysis shows substantial long-period NW energy (<strong>15–17 s</strong>, H1/3 7–8.<strong>5 ft</strong>; H1/10 up to ~<strong>11 ft</strong>). Islands and reef geometry will refract/diffract a portion of that energy into south-facing reefs. Expect the wrap to be:
  - Most effective at reef points with clear refractive corridors (Diamond Head, some east-side reef passes).
  - Moderately effective elsewhere — Ala Moana and most of Waikiki will remain dominated by the direct SSE <strong>2 ft</strong> component and are largely protected from the full NW pulse.
  - Intermittent in timing — long-period NW sets will come in low frequency (long intervals), produce steeper faces when they do, then lapse back to the small SSE rhythm.
- Practical expectations: where wrap lines build, faces can run chest–head+ at peak sets (H1/3 estimates <strong>3–5 ft</strong> locally); where protected, expect the measured SSE ~<strong>2 ft</strong> H1/3 (≈2.<strong>6 ft</strong> H1/10) with long, soft faces.
- Physics-based outlook: a separate far-northern storm (modeled Kamchatka event) is projected to arrive Oct 16 (<strong>6 ft</strong> @ 20 s), which could amplify northwest energy after our 3-day window — keep an eye on Friday for a more organized northern pulse.</p>
<p>Confidence statement and data completeness
- Confidence: medium (0.69). Buoy coverage strong (12/13), charts/satellite/tides/METAR all available and consistent. The main uncertainty is how much of the large NW energy will refract into specific south reef corridors — local bathymetry and small-angle refraction create spotty, high-variance outcomes. Expect clean, small south conditions for longboarders in town; expect occasional, steeper NW-wrapped sets at exposed reefs with higher shortboard potential but more inconsistency.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Friday–Sunday (Oct 13–15) is a mellow South Shore window overall — best for longboards and cruisy sessions (Waikiki, Ala Moana). Keep an eye on Diamond Head and east reef passes for intermittent long-period NW sets that will be steeper and faster; those are higher-skill, lower-frequency opportunities. Watch for increased NW energy after Oct 15 with the modeled Kamchatka arrival on Oct 16.</p>

        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>HEADLINE: Big long‑period NW energy on the North Shore — heavy, powerful and for experienced chargers only; South Shore tiny and clean.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE: Faces: NW–N; swell: dominant NW ~<strong>16–17s</strong> (H1/3 ~8.<strong>5 ft</strong>; H1/10 est ~<strong>11 ft</strong>) — expect very large, fast sets at exposed breaks; best window: today mid‑afternoon into evening (swell already in and holding) — extreme caution, expect heavy shorebreak, strong currents and big reef/paddleouts.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE: Faces: S–SSE; swell: small SSE ~<strong>2 ft</strong> @13s — waist‑to‑chest at protected beach breaks; best window: morning→midday when winds stay light; not worthwhile at exposed south reefs.</p>
<p>EAST / WEST quick hits:
- EAST: Light ENE winds give generally clean, small surf for east-facing breaks — good for SUP/longboard.
- WEST: Minimal energy; small and inconsistent — OK for beginners at protected spots.</p>
<p>WINDS: METAR PHNL 070° at 6 kt (light ENE trades). Winds are light enough to keep north and east exposures relatively clean; expect light cross‑shore at some inside Waikiki breaks but nothing gusty. Conditions should stay under ~10 kt today.</p>
<p>TIDES: Latest obs 10/13 22:30 HST = 1.<strong>34 ft</strong> (tide running low‑moderate). (Note: recent high/low reference: 10/12 high ~2.<strong>20 ft</strong>, low ~0.<strong>21 ft</strong>.) Check NOAA station 1612340 for exact high/low times before you go.</p>
<p>ACTION ITEM: If you’re not comfortable in large, long‑period NW surf with big currents and reef/paddle hazards — do not go. Experts: pick an established big‑wave spot with water patrol, aim for mid→high tide this afternoon/evening when shape will be most consistent. Casual surfers/learners: stay on the south/east protected breaks this morning.</p>
