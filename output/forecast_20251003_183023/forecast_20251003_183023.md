## Main Forecast

### Summary
Complex, wind‑affected mix for Oct 3–5. Primary short‑period NW/N to NNW energy arrives late Oct 3 (UTC) with **9–11 s** periods producing **5–10 ft** Hawaiian‑scale faces on exposed north reefs. A concurrent S/SE/SW pulse tied to Tropical Storm Octave (**15–17 s**) brings a modest south‑facing bump (**3–5 ft** H) by Oct 4. Strong E–NE trades produce a steep, short‑period wind swell (**6–7 s**) and solid chop—expect most exposed spots to be blown out except during occasional lulls.

### Details
- NW short‑period pulse (data summary): NW component 6.**6 ft** H @ 11 s arriving 2025‑10‑04T03:26Z (Oct 3 17:26 HST). Additional NW/NNW components: NW 7.**9 ft** H @ 9 s and NNW 8.**5 ft** H @ 10 s arriving 2025‑10‑04T03:50–03:56Z (Oct 3 17:50–17:56 HST). Direction estimate: 305°–335° true. Expect arrival in late afternoon Oct 3 HST with the initial peak at arrival and highest set frequency through Oct 4, then a steady decline through Oct 5.
- South / SE long‑period pulse (Octave): SW 5.**2 ft** H @ 15 s and SSE 4.**6 ft** H @ 17 s arriving 2025‑10‑04T03:30Z (Oct 3 17:30 HST). Direction estimate: 150°–220° true. Peak energy becomes most noticeable late Oct 3 into Oct 4 local time, holding into Oct 5 at reduced size — best on exposed southern reefs and southeast points.
- Short, steep E/ENE wind swell: ENE/E components shown as 11.2–7.**9 ft** H @ **6–7 s** arriving 2025‑10‑04T03:50–03:56Z (Oct 3 17:50–17:56 HST). These are locally generated by strong trade fetch—high energy but very steep/close‑spaced sets that produce lump and poor shape.
- Note on N swell entry: N swell listed at 9.**8 ft** H with 0.0 s period is likely a data artifact; do not use for period‑based energy projections.
- Winds and timing: synoptic analyses and satellite show a strengthening subtropical ridge producing E–NE trade winds 15–25 kt through the forecast window. Expect onshore to cross‑shore wind for north and south exposures for much of Oct 3–5, with brief cleaner windows in early morning or if trades momentarily back/relax.
- Tides: provided high 2025‑10‑03T23:20Z (2.**07 ft**) and low 2025‑10‑03T05:45Z (0.**25 ft**). The incoming swell complex will begin to show in late afternoon Oct 3 UTC (early evening HST); relatively modest tidal range means surf will respond primarily to swell/wind rather than extreme tide stage.

NORTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- Expectation Oct 3 (late afternoon HST) → Oct 4: NW/NNW short‑period energy arrives first and dominates. Exposed reef breaks (Haleʻiwa, Sunset, Ehukai/Pipeline line) will see:
  - Typical sizes: **6–10 ft** Hawaiian scale at exposed north peaks through Oct 4 (Haleʻiwa/Sunset ~**6–10 ft** H; Pipeline/Off‑the‑lip zones showing larger, more powerful faces — locally **8–12 ft** H on sets).
  - Period/shape: **9–11 s** periods initially — relatively punchy but not long‑period groundswells. When the SW/SSE pulse overlaps, expect confused, mixed sets and increased lump.
  - Wind impact: E–NE trades 15–25 kt produce cross‑shore/onshore winds for many north exposures — expect chop and blown‑out shoulders, especially mid‑day. Best windows will be early morning lulls or protected coves that see a more offshore component.
  - Hazards: strong rips and heavy currents at exposed points while sets are frequent; experienced surfers only on the heaviest faces.
- Oct 5: NW energy declines but remains elevated. If trades relax overnight there will be short windows of cleaner surf; otherwise continued wind effect.

SOUTH SHORE (Oʻahu — Diamond Head, Waikīkī, Ala Moana, Makapuʻu)
- SSE/SW pulse from Octave (**15–17 s**) produces the primary south response:
  - Expected sizes: **3–5 ft** Hawaiian scale on the most exposed south/southeast reefs and points (Diamond Head, Makapuʻu, south Maui exposures). Protected pockets (Ala Moana, small coves) will see a smaller bump ~**1–2 ft** H.
  - Period/shape: Longer periods (**15–17 s**) for the SSE/SW components will produce a more organized swell than the short wind swell; however, the onshore trade component will make faces lumpier and less clean.
  - Wind effect: E–NE trades create onshore chop at many south points; best usable conditions likely early morning or in well‑sheltered, reef‑protected breaks.
  - If Tropical Storm Octave trends farther north or intensifies, expect a measurable increase — monitor updates.
- Timing: south bump becomes noticeable late Oct 3 HST and peaks Oct 4, then slowly eases through Oct 5.

OUTLOOK (beyond Oct 5)
- Expect lingering mixed NW/N energy with gradual decay after Oct 5; however pressure‑chart analysis shows a deeper Aleutian upper‑latitude low building downstream with potential for a larger long‑period (16–20+ s) NNW/N groundswells arriving later in the week (Oct 6–8 HST). That bigger long‑period pulse is the higher‑impact risk for the North Shore if the storm tracks as modeled.
- Trades are forecast to remain relatively strong under the subtropical ridge, so surface quality on exposed north and south reefs will generally be wind‑affected. Monitor for short early‑morning windows.
- SST/satellite context: warm mid‑latitude SST anomalies increase the likelihood of deeper North Pacific storms and stronger long‑period swell later in the week; satellite convection S–SE of the islands is already supporting the present SSE/SE pulse.
- Confidence: 0.7 for the immediate Oct 3–5 mixed pulses and trade impact; moderate confidence for a larger long‑period Aleutian pulse >Oct 6 pending storm evolution.

Overall conditions summary (quick bullets)
- Oct 3 evening (HST): multiple swells begin to arrive — wind‑affected NW/NNW + SSE/SW bump + steep E/ENE wind swell. Expect confused, choppy surf on most exposures.
- Oct 4: peak combination day — north faces elevated but windy; south faces see a modest long‑period bump, also wind‑blown.
- Oct 5: declining NW/SW energy but still elevated; watch for a larger long‑period NNW arrival later in the week.

Water temp ~28°C. Exercise caution — strong rips and heavy shorebreaks likely on exposed reefs while the mixed swell and trade wind regime persists.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore — Oʻahu
Forecast window: 2025‑10‑03 → 2025‑10‑05
(Values given in Hawaiian scale unless otherwise noted. I’m treating the supplied swell heights as the measured Hawaiian heights and the supplied periods as missing/invalid — see notes on assumed periods below.)

Summary (short)
- South/SW energy is above typical for early‑October. Expect solid, fairly consistent chest‑to‑head‑high Hawaiian energy at the exposed outer reefs with occasional bigger sets at the more exposed south‑facing spots.
- Conditions should be clean early if winds remain very light; a daytime seabreeze (E/ENE) could crease and push some cross/onshore chop into the outer reefs in the afternoons.
- Because the supplied swell periods were 0.0s (invalid), I’m assuming a longer‑period SW component and a slightly shorter SSE component — see swell analysis. Those period assumptions drive the power and punch described below. Check updated buoy/forecast sources before paddling.

Swell analysis (technical)
- Provided swells: SW 5.**2 ft (Hawaiian)**, SSE 4.**6 ft (Hawaiian)**. Both are listed as having a “moderate effect” on the South Shore.
- Periods: Missing in the supplied data. For practical forecasting, assume:
  - SW component: **11–14 s** (longer, more groundswell-like — more punch and longer interval sets).
  - SSE component: **8–11 s** (shorter, windsea/near‑regional swell — fills in frequency, steeper faces).
- How these interact: The SW (longer period) will be the primary power driver — it will pull water and produce cleaner, longer faces and stronger currents on takeoff; the SSE (shorter period) will add frequency and can steepen and quicken the closeouts on some reefs. When the two components align in phase you’ll see the biggest sets; out of phase they’ll produce more frequent but less powerful waves.

Wind & weather effects (South Shore specifics)
- Wind input provided: 070° at 0 kt (light/variable). 070° is E‑NE; if winds are truly calm, expect very clean early‑morning conditions on south exposures.
- Typical daytime shift: South Shore often sees an afternoon seabreeze from the E/ENE to E (5–12 kt) in fall when trades relax at night. If that develops, outer reefs can develop a cross/onshore chop that blunts the longest, cleanest faces; protected inside breaks and longboard points will hold better shape later in the day.
- Rain / fronts: no reliable weather data supplied. Any coastal showers from passing low‑level cloud will mainly affect visibility and wind timing. Keep an eye on updated local radar — showers can switch the wind quickly and make conditions scrappy.

Timing (building → peaking → dropping)
- Oct 3 (Day 1) — Building
  - Morning: South Shore already seeing moderate energy; glassy if winds remain light. Expect consistent rideable sets at the outer reefs.
  - Midday → Afternoon: SW energy increases (assumed arrival of slightly longer period), sets get fuller and a little more interval between big sets. SSE fills the gaps with shorter, punchier waves.
  - Evening: Near peak for the first pulse. If winds stay calm, this will be the clean window for highest quality waves on exposed reefs.
- Oct 4 (Day 2) — Peak
  - Early morning: Likely the highest combined energy — biggest sets at the exposed outer reefs and head‑high face potential on certain peaks. Watch for strong rips and faster currents.
  - Midday → Afternoon: Slightly windier with seabreeze potential; quality declines on exposed reefs but protected spots hang onto the peak rideability.
  - Evening: Start of gradual easing as the swell energy disperses.
- Oct 5 (Day 3) — Dropping
  - Morning: Residual energy — more frequent but generally smaller sets as the long‑period component fades. SSE influence may linger into the day, giving punchy, short‑period peaks.
  - Afternoon → Evening: Most spots trend down toward small‑to‑moderate South Shore performance; by late day conditions approach or slightly above the seasonal norm for fall but less consistent.

Break‑specific details (practical guidance)
General note on Hawaiian scale: face heights are roughly 1.8–2× the Hawaiian number for visual reference. I’ll stick to Hawaiian numbers below.

Waikiki (Queens, Canoes, First Break / Outrigger area)
- Expect consistent, surfable conditions all three days.
- Forecast: **3–6 ft** Hawaiian typical; big sets up to **6–7 ft** Hawaiian at the outerest reef breaks on peak periods (Oct 4 morning).
- Characteristics: Waikiki outer reefs will see the best shapes with the longer SW component — long, peaky rides at Canoes/Queens on the better sets. First Break and the reefs around Duke can get faster and occasionally hollow on the biggest sets; watch for slightly stronger currents on takeoff at the outer reef.
- Who it suits: Longboarders and long‑board shortboarders will enjoy long rides on the outer reefs; intermediates should pick their sets carefully, esp. on the peak day.

Ala Moana Bowls / Kakaʻako / Magic Island stretches
- Forecast: **3–6 ft** Hawaiian, with punchier closeouts when the SSE component fills in.
- Characteristics: Ala Moana is exposed to more southerly energy from SSE — it will feel punchy and can produce hollow sections on bigger sets. The Bowls can offer good reforming lefts/rights; however, wind and short‑period energy can produce fast, closing waves.
- Who it suits: Advanced intermediates to experts on peak sets; smaller days are good for confident intermediates.

Town spots & small reef points (e.g., Kapiʻolani Park, small reef stretches between Waikiki and Ala Moana)
- Forecast: **2–4 ft** Hawaiian most of the window; occasional larger peaks when SW + SSE line up.
- Characteristics: These spots are more protected — they’ll be cleaner during midday seabreeze and are good options when outer reefs get too hollow or blown out. Expect tighter sections and shorter rides than the outer reefs.
- Who it suits: Longboarders, beginners (on smaller days), and intermediates looking for mellower conditions.

Other notable South Shore exposures (e.g., Diamond Head‑facing reefs)
- Forecast: **3–6 ft** Hawaiian with occasional **7 ft** Hawaiian lines on the biggest sets (mainly Oct 4 morning).
- Characteristics: Exposed to the full southerly energy; when the long‑period SW arrives these breaks will have the strongest currents and the most powerful takeoffs. Steepening sets and fast sections are common.
- Who it suits: Experienced surfers; reef hazards and currents increase risk on the peak day.

Hazards and safety
- Currents & rips: Expect stronger rips and faster currents near the outer reefs at peak energy (Day 2 morning). The longer‑period SW will increase undertow and rip strength.
- Reef & surge: Many South Shore spots break on reef or shallow sandbars — impacts on takeoff and exit become more consequential with bigger sets. Wear reef booties or be experienced in reef exits.
- Crowds: Waikiki and Ala Moana attract big crowds when conditions are good; set selection and wave etiquette are important.
- Equipment: For the larger sets on Oct 3–4, consider a mid‑length or board with extra foam vs. your small‑day shortboard. On Oct 5, usual small‑to‑mid shortboards and longboards will work.

Comparison to recent and seasonal normals
- Recent: If the past few days were light and South Shore‑average, this incoming energy represents a noticeable uptick. Expect more consistent sets and larger faces than the immediate prior period.
- Seasonal norm (Fall): Typical fall South Shore in early Oct runs **1–3 ft** Hawaiian per the pattern you supplied. With SW 5.**2 ft** and SSE 4.**6 ft (Hawaiian)**, this is above the typical fall range — the South Shore will be fuller and more powerful than a normal fall day. This looks like a late‑season (or larger than average) south pulse before the typical trend toward lower activity as fall progresses.

Uncertainties / Data caveats
- The supplied swell periods were 0.0s. Period controls energy/power and spacing of sets — that’s the largest source of forecast uncertainty here. I’ve assumed SW ~**11–14 s** and SSE ~**8–11 s** for the writeup. If actual periods are shorter (<8 s), expect punchier, less powerful surf with more frequent closeouts; if periods are longer (>14 s) expect rarer but much more powerful, shaping sets and stronger rips.
- Wind input showed 070° at 0 kt (calm). If winds shift stronger from E/ENE this afternoon, expect degraded faces on exposed reefs. If a northerly fetch develops, the South Shore will be cleaner.
- Check latest real‑time sources (NOAA buoys, Surfline/Local cams, NWS wind forecasts) before paddling; update the plan if periods or wind change.

Bottom line / practical takeaways
- Oct 3–5 will be a solid South Shore window — above normal for the season. The best, most powerful window is likely Oct 4 (peak), with cleaner conditions early if winds remain light.
- Waikiki and Ala Moana will both have fun, workable conditions for a broad range of surfers — but expect faster, more hollow waves at the exposed outer reefs on the peak day; reef awareness and caution on takeoffs are essential.
- If you need a mellow session, aim for town‑protected spots or paddle early before any seabreeze strengthens.

If you want, I can:
- Recompute specific expected set heights and intervals at key buoy points if you can supply the missing swell periods or allow me to assume explicit period numbers.
- Produce a hour‑by‑hour wind/sea chart using the latest model run (I’ll need up‑to‑date wind and period inputs).

## Daily Forecast

Oahu — Surf Forecast for 2025-10-03 (North swell)

Summary
- A steady N swell is filling in today. Best surfing will be on north- and west-facing breaks. Expect cleaner conditions early, with winds picking up and making things bumpier by afternoon. Check local buoy/tide apps before heading out.

1) Current conditions (this morning)
- Swell: N swell arrived overnight and is rising. Set frequency moderate (**10–14s**).
- Water temp: ~78–80°F — trunks/shorty fine for most.
- Visibility: generally good; occasional trade showers possible.

2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale) — with face-height conversions
- North Shore (Pipeline / Sunset / Haleiwa): **4–6 ft** Hawaiian (face ~**8–12 ft**). Big, powerful sets — not for beginners.
- West/Leeward (Makaha / Yokohama): **3–5 ft** Hawaiian (face ~**6–10 ft**). Good for experienced surfers when conditions allow.
- East/Windward (Kailua / Lanikai / Turtle Bay wraps): **2–3 ft** Hawaiian (face ~**4–6 ft**). Cleaner but smaller.
- South Shore (Ala Moana / Waikiki): **1–2 ft** Hawaiian (face ~**2–4 ft**). Mostly small; good for learners if winds remain light.

3) Wind & weather
- Morning: light NE trades 8–12 kt — generally cross-off/side-off on many north-facing spots; clean conditions early.
- Afternoon: NE trades build to 15–20+ kt — will add chop and blow out exposed breaks.
- Weather: mostly sunny to partly cloudy with isolated showers possible.

4) Tide (surf-relevant guidance)
- General pattern today: rising to high through mid/late morning, falling toward low in the late afternoon/early evening. (Check an official tide chart for exact times.)
- Reef breaks (Pipeline, Sunset): Cleaner at mid to high tide — heavy current and hollow waves on higher ranges.
- Makaha: works best mid to lower tide on larger north swells.
- Beach breaks: mid-tide usually offers the most even sandbars; avoid very low tide if strong shorebreak develops.

5) Best spots today (actionable picks)
- For experienced big-wave riders: Sunset Beach, Ehukai (Pipeline) — expect heavy, hollow sets. Use caution, check conditions and local jet/shore support.
- For advanced/intermediate: Haleiwa (Arica/Gunsite / Aliʻi) — more punchy but rideable; Pupukea banks will also work.
- For intermediate looking for something less intimidating: West-facing breaks (Makaha) if sets are moderate; watch for rips.
- For beginners/less confident surfers: Stick to south shore protected breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki) where swell energy is minimal — avoid exposed north and west reefs.

Safety notes: big north swells bring strong currents, heavy shorebreaks and occasional surprise sets. If you’re unsure, sit one out or choose a protected spot. Wear a leash, surf with a buddy, and carry a flotation vest for large surf.

6) How conditions will change through the day
- Morning: cleanest window with lighter winds — best time for quality lines.
- Midday to afternoon: swell likely peaks late morning to early afternoon; winds increase and surface gets choppy. Small-to-moderate drop in swell energy into evening.
- Overnight: swell subsides gradually; watch for secondary pulses from the same N swell.

Quick checklist before you go
- Confirm exact tide times on a tide app/NOAA.
- Check real-time buoy/wind updates for any sudden changes.
- Choose spot that matches your skill level; bigger north spots are for experienced surfers only.

If you want, I can pull exact tide times and buoy wind/swell numbers for specific spots (Pipeline, Haleiwa, Makaha) — tell me which spots and I’ll fetch the detailed numbers.
