Side/off for many North Shore reefs; onshore chop for E shores.\n\nDETAILS\n- NNW (330\u2013350\u00b0) long-period source: Deep 970 mb low near 48N/155W moving ENE with strong post-frontal WNW\u2013NW fetch aimed on the periphery at HI (pressure charts). Travel 2.5\u20133.5 days for 14\u201317 s energy puts forerunners late Fri, main swell Sun 10/19 into Mon. Physics-based guidance aligns (Gulf Alaska 4 ft @ 14 s Sun pre-dawn). Near-term impact for our window: only late Fri forerunners, H1/3 ~2\u20133 ft, sets 4\u20135 ft at best 330\u2013350\u00b0 magnets. Buoys to watch: 51101/51001 for a jump in 15\u201317 s.\n- Near-field NW (320\u2013340\u00b0) mid-period: A 1008 mb low ~30N/170W with a tightened gradient against a 1023 mb high provides a shorter-period NW fetch. Arrival quicker and wind-affected. Physics shows 5 ft @ 13 s timed for Fri 10/17 ~1915 HST, matching a PM rise. Expect the practical nearshore translation to H1/3 3\u20135 ft late Fri for the best NW exposures; sets to 6\u20137 ft faces. Buoy 51001 should lead with 10\u201313 s energy Thurs night/Fri AM.\n- WNW (300\u2013315\u00b0) follow-up: Compact gale near 38N/170E translating ENE along the baroclinic zone sends modest WNW next in line. Arrival after our window; build Sun\u2013Mon to H1/3 4\u20136 ft at magnets; H1/10 6\u20138 ft.\n- South side: Southern Ocean belt looks zonal on satellite with no strong, north-aimed fetch. Ongoing background S\u2013SSW 13\u201316 s keeps H1/3 1.5\u20132.5 ft with occasional 3\u20134 ft set faces at top focal reefs, easing slowly into Fri. Buoy 51004 holds small long-period.\n- Trades/East: High pressure ridging maintains moderate E\u2013ENE trades. Wind-chop holds H1/3 2\u20134 ft; H1/10 sets to 5 ft for exposed windward reefs. Buoys 51211/51212 steady.\n- Weather/winds: METAR PHNL 07009KT at 2253 HST supports moderate trades. Expect typical diurnal: lightest early, locally enhanced PM. No tropical systems (TWOCP: no formation 7 days). Frontal bands remain far NE.\n- Data notes: Altimetry, models, and nearshore buoys are missing; upper-air limited. Confidence medium (0.68). Leaning on pressure charts, satellite, and physics-based travel times; verify with NDBC 51101/51001/51003/51004.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Wed 10/15: Small. H1/3 1\u20132 ft; H1/10 sets to 3 ft. Mixed old NNW/WNW crumbs. Light AM trades, cleanest early. \n- Thu 10/16: Slow rise late. H1/3 2\u20133 ft; sets 4 ft at 320\u2013340\u00b0 magnets late PM. Expect more 9\u201312 s than long-period energy.\n- Fri 10/17: Building PM. Morning 2\u20133 ft; late-day H1/3 3\u20135 ft at best NW exposures; H1/10 sets 6\u20137 ft faces. First 14\u201316 s NNW forerunners possible by evening. Wind E\u2013ENE 10\u201320 kt, side/off for many lineups; bump increases PM.\n- Key spots: Early-season reefs with NW window favor the near-field pulse. Northerly-leaning, shadowed spots smaller. Watch outer buoys 51001/51101 for the pulse timing.\n\nWEST SIDE\n- Similar trend, a notch under the North Shore for NNW; near-field NW has better angle. \n- Wed: 1\u20132 ft. Thu: 2\u20133 ft. Fri PM: 3\u20134 ft, sets 5\u20136 ft at standouts like Makaha late.\n- Trades side-on in the afternoons; best early.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Wed\u2013Thu: Holding small but rideable at focal reefs. H1/3 1.5\u20132.5 ft; inconsistent 3\u20134 ft faces on the better sets.\n- Fri: Gradual ease; more inconsistent. \n- Winds: Morning land-breeze glass possible; light-moderate trades bring texture by late morning. Buoy 51004 shows small 14\u201316 s background; no significant reinforcements during the window.\n\nEAST SHORE\n- Persistent trades. H1/3 2\u20134 ft; H1/10 sets to 5 ft. Short-period, choppy; best for windsurf/foil. No remote easterly swell source noted.\n\nTIDES/NOTES\n- Moderate diurnal swings; evening lows near 0.2 ft (NOAA 1612340). Latest obs 1.57 ft at 2312 HST 10/15. Plan for slower water movement mid-mornings, more push on mid-day highs.\n\nOUTLOOK\n- Sat 10/18: Continued build from the near-field NW overnight keeps North Shore in the moderate band early, with the first real 14\u201316 s NNW lines filling late day. \n- Sun 10/19: Primary NNW from the Gulf low fills in. Expect H1/3 trending 4\u20136 ft at 330\u2013350\u00b0 magnets; H1/10 6\u20138 ft faces, possibly higher if 51101 spikes >3 ft at 15\u201317 s (pressure chart had 6\u20139 ft H1/3 potential; hedging lower until buoys confirm). Physics: 4 ft @ 14 s arrival window supports the morning ramp.\n- Mon 10/20: NNW holds with a WNW blend from the dateline/Kamchatka side (physics 3 ft @ 11 s). Maintain moderate surf with mixed periods. \n- Trades persist; no tropical threats (TWOCP: none 7 days).\n\nBuoy references: 51101/51001 (NW/NNW long-period), 51003 (WNW), 51004 (S), 51211/51212 (E trades). Gaps: altimetry/models/nearshore not available; updates may adjust size/timing once outer buoys show forerunners.",
  "north_shore": "Dominant NW (307\u00b0) mid-period swell in the mix: buoys show a sharp 14.4 ft H1/3 at 14 s with H1/10 to ~18.8 ft late Wed 10/15; that pencils out to roughly 22\u201326 ft faces on the most exposed outer reefs for the bulk of sets (H1/3) with occasional 30\u201334 ft faces on the biggest 1/10 waves, in a brief window centered Wed evening through early Thu, then trending down through Thu and Fri. A smaller Aleutian NW reinforcement near 5 ft at 13 s is due late Fri evening, nudging the surf back up after dark.\n\nWind and tide: Light to moderate ENE trades near 5\u201312 kt favor early sessions with side-off to offshore flow for many North Shore reefs; expect rising texture and some wind bump by midday, easing toward sunset. Evening lows are on the small side (~0\u20130.3 ft reported Wed), which will make Pipe/Ehukai extra shallow and ledgy and speed up channels at Sunset; mid-morning to midday higher tides will soften the heaviest reefs and improve entry/exit. Tidal details beyond Wed are incomplete, so treat exact tide windows Thu\u2013Fri with moderate uncertainty.\n\nFlagship breaks\n- Pipeline/Backdoor (exposure weight moderate to high to 300\u2013320\u00b0; less efficient on pure N): Wed PM if the buoy spike verifies, 10\u201315+ ft faces with occasional 18\u201320 ft sets, very heavy and shallow on the evening low; easing Thu from 8\u201312 ft AM to 6\u201310 ft PM; Fri 5\u20138 ft faces with a slight evening tick up. Best early with light E\u2013ENE; lower tide increases risk of step-lipping closeouts.\n- Sunset (high exposure, takes NW and N cleanly): Wed PM jumps to outer-reef size, 15\u201322 ft faces with plus sets possible; Thu easing from 12\u201318 ft AM to 10\u201315 ft PM; Fri 8\u201312 ft AM, holding or nudging up late with the 13 s reinforcement. Trades are quartering offshore; channels will be swift on the evening lows.\n- Waimea (needs size, prefers NW\u2013N mix): If the NW/N buoy spike translates nearshore, Waimea can turn on late Wed into early Thu with 18\u201322 ft faces on the larger sets, then easing below threshold by Thu PM; Fri likely below breaking most of the day. Confidence lower here given the brevity of the buoy peak; plan for rapid changes and long lulls.\n\nBuoy evidence and exposure notes\n- Primary driver is the NW 307\u00b0 at 14 s, exposure weight ~0.82, so the best-open reefs (Sunset, outer reefs, Waimea Bay exposure) take the brunt.\n- Secondary N energy 350\u2013354\u00b0 at 13 s (exposure ~0.50) adds set variability and favors more northerly-facing reefs (Sunset, Lani\u2019s) while being less efficient at Pipe/Backdoor.\n- W 268\u00b0 and S 186\u00b0 energy showing on buoys has little direct impact on the North Shore due to shadowing.\n\nHazards\n- With outer-reef faces reaching the 20\u201330 ft tier during the Wed night/early Thu window, expect powerful rip currents, long-period surges, wide wash-throughs on reefs, and harbor surging. Shorebreak will be hazardous near low tide, especially around Ehukai/Pupukea.\n\nTrend through the period\n- Wed 10/15: Rapid evening rise to extra-large on best exposures if the buoy spike holds; heavy, uneven sets with a north tilt in the mix.\n- Thu 10/16: Down but still solid in the morning; steady fade through the day.\n- Fri 10/17: Smaller morning surf; slight evening bump as 5 ft @ 13 s NW arrives, more noticeable after dark and into Saturday.\n\nConfidence: Medium (0.68). Buoy coverage is good (14/17) and supports the NW/N mix, but the extreme NW reading is a narrow-time spike and key feeds are missing (no altimetry, no nearshore buoy/model guidance, no upper-air), so nearshore translation and Waimea thresholds carry moderate uncertainty. Trades and tide interplay are broadly favorable for mornings; precise tide windows Thu\u2013Fri are less certain.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast (O\u2018ahu): Wed Oct 15 \u2013 Fri Oct 17, 2025\n\n1) Opening assessment: size, direction, timing\n- Primary source: background southern hemi S to SSSW lines near 180\u2013190\u00b0 at 14s early Wednesday, easing through the period. No new southern reinforcements within the 3-day window.\n- Wrap: long-period W\u2013NW energy in the broader basin is significant for the North/West shores but has low wrap efficiency into Town; only slight late-week influence for the far SW exposures (Barbers/Ewa).\n- Expected breaker heights (Hawaiian scale, H1/3) with H1/10 set estimates:\n  - Wed 10/15: 1.5\u20132 ft H1/3, sets to 2.5\u20133 ft H1/10 at the top S-facing magnets early; easing late.\n  - Thu 10/16: 1\u20132 ft H1/3, sets to 2\u20132.5 ft H1/10; more inconsistent as period trims toward 12\u201313s.\n  - Fri 10/17: 1 ft H1/3, occasional 1.5\u20132 ft H1/10 at best reefs; late-day tiny W wrap possible for Barbers/Ewa, not meaningful for Town.\n\n2) Town vs. outlier breaks; tides and winds\n- Ala Moana/Kewalos/Bowls:\n  - Directional fit: The 180\u2013190\u00b0 band lines up best for Bowls/Kewalos; the 14s energy favors refraction into the deeper Town channels, but with long lulls.\n  - Expect the largest sets here each morning: Wed dawn the best window for waist-chest peaks (H1/10 to 3 ft), easing to knee-thigh by Fri with infrequent pluses.\n  - Tides: Midday higher water will soften the small surf; the evening lower tide near Wed\u2019s 0.2 ft low (around 7 PM) gives a bit more push on the reefs. Expect the evening lows to shift later each day.\n  - Winds: Trades trending E\u2013ENE. Light to gentle early (around 5\u201310 kt; PHNL 07009 at 0853Z), building mid-late morning to moderate. Cleanest 6\u20139 AM; texture after mid-morning.\n- Waikiki:\n  - More shadowing and slower reefs: 0.5\u20131.5 ft Wed\u2013Thu with rare thigh-high pulses; down a notch Fri. Best on logs or big fish. High tide will bog it; aim for lower tide windows near sunset for a little extra push.\n- Diamond Head:\n  - Exposure and wind: Picks up the S lines but sits more open to the trades; expect sideshore bump as winds rise. Size similar to Town Wed (knee-waist with a few pluses), trending down. Early morning is key before the trades return; mid-day will be textured to choppy.\n- Outliers (wrap potential):\n  - Barbers/Ewa: Minimal, late-week contribution from long-period W\u2013NW energy may add knee-high, inconsistent wrap late Fri. Town reefs remain largely shadowed from the NW events; no meaningful help there.\n\n3) Board call and crowd/consistency\n- Consistency: Long-period background pulses mean pronounced lulls\u201412\u201318 minutes between the better sets, longest on Thu\u2013Fri.\n- Best craft:\n  - Wed: Longboards and high-volume shortboards at the magnets; competent shortboards can sample the larger sets at Bowls/Kewalos early.\n  - Thu\u2013Fri: Logs and mid-lengths rule. Groveler fish for the magnets; standard shortboards will be underfed.\n- Crowds: Typical Town shoulder seasons\u2014peaks draw a pack during the morning glass. The fading trend should thin it some by Fri, but magnets will still be competitive for the few set waves.\n\n4) Background pulses, wrap specifics, and local wind/reef nuances\n- Southern hemi background: The 14s S pulse peaking early Wed is the tail of the fall run; decay expected ~0.5 ft/day with gradual period shortening. No fresh fetch signals in the southern belt for the 72-hr window.\n- Wrap mechanics: The notable NW/N energy in the basin (buoy indications to 14\u201315s) directs at winter shores. With O\u2018ahu\u2019s geometry and island blocking, Town doesn\u2019t see this; only far SW corners (Barbers/Ewa) might feel a tiny, late Fri knee-high whisper via diffraction/refraction.\n- Winds: E\u2013ENE trade regime favors early glass for Town, then moderate sideshore at Diamond Head and light cross/off for Ala Moana. Quality index 0.46 reflects the modest trades texture and small surf.\n- Tides: Evening lows assist small-surf draw on shallow reefs; midday highs slow it, especially inside Waikiki.\n\n5) Confidence statement\n- Overall confidence: Medium (0.68). Charts, satellite, buoys, and climatology align on a fading S background with no new southern reinforcements. That said, several feeds are missing (altimetry, nearshore buoys, upper-air, and model guidance), and one deep-water S reading appears inflated relative to recent local response\u2014so sizes lean conservative and weighted toward observed Town behavior in October. Expect minor day-to-day adjustments tied to trade strength and tide timing rather than new swell.\n\nBottom line\n- Wed: Best of the run. Town magnets 1.5\u20132 ft H1/3, sets to 2.5\u20133 ft early; clean AM with long lulls.\n- Thu: Down a notch. 1\u20132 ft with rare 2+ ft sets at magnets; more inconsistent; morning glass.\n- Fri: Smallest. Around 1 ft with infrequent 1.5\u20132 ft sets; logs/mids. Tiny late-day W wrap for Barbers; negligible for Town.",
