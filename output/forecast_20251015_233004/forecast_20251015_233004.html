<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dominant action: a near-field NW builds late Thu into Fri, with the more powerful, longer-period NNW not peaking until after our window.</li>
<li>Expect North Shore H1/3 around <strong>1–2 ft</strong> Wed, <strong>2–3 ft</strong> Thu, building <strong>3–5 ft</strong> by dusk Fri at best NW exposures; H1/10 sets up to <strong>7 ft</strong> faces late Fri.</li>
<li>Trades: E–ENE 10–20 kt typical for fall; lighter mornings, breezier afternoons. Side/off for many North Shore reefs; onshore chop for E shores.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>NNW (330–350°) long-period source: Deep 970 mb low near 48N/155W moving ENE with strong post-frontal WNW–NW fetch aimed on the periphery at HI (pressure charts). Travel 2.5–3.5 days for <strong>14–17 s</strong> energy puts forerunners late Fri, main swell Sun 10/19 into Mon. Physics-based guidance aligns (Gulf Alaska <strong>4 ft</strong> @ 14 s Sun pre-dawn). Near-term impact for our window: only late Fri forerunners, H1/3 ~<strong>2–3 ft</strong>, sets <strong>4–5 ft</strong> at best 330–350° magnets. Buoys to watch: 51101/51001 for a jump in <strong>15–17 s</strong>.</li>
<li>Near-field NW (320–340°) mid-period: A 1008 mb low ~30N/170W with a tightened gradient against a 1023 mb high provides a shorter-period NW fetch. Arrival quicker and wind-affected. Physics shows <strong>5 ft</strong> @ 13 s timed for Fri 10/17 ~1915 HST, matching a PM rise. Expect the practical nearshore translation to H1/3 <strong>3–5 ft</strong> late Fri for the best NW exposures; sets to <strong>6–7 ft</strong> faces. Buoy 51001 should lead with <strong>10–13 s</strong> energy Thurs night/Fri AM.</li>
<li>WNW (300–315°) follow-up: Compact gale near 38N/170E translating ENE along the baroclinic zone sends modest WNW next in line. Arrival after our window; build Sun–Mon to H1/3 <strong>4–6 ft</strong> at magnets; H1/10 <strong>6–8 ft</strong>.</li>
<li>South side: Southern Ocean belt looks zonal on satellite with no strong, north-aimed fetch. Ongoing background S–SSW <strong>13–16 s</strong> keeps H1/3 1.5–2.<strong>5 ft</strong> with occasional <strong>3–4 ft</strong> set faces at top focal reefs, easing slowly into Fri. Buoy 51004 holds small long-period.</li>
<li>Trades/East: High pressure ridging maintains moderate E–ENE trades. Wind-chop holds H1/3 <strong>2–4 ft</strong>; H1/10 sets to <strong>5 ft</strong> for exposed windward reefs. Buoys 51211/51212 steady.</li>
<li>Weather/winds: METAR PHNL 07009KT at 2253 HST supports moderate trades. Expect typical diurnal: lightest early, locally enhanced PM. No tropical systems (TWOCP: no formation 7 days). Frontal bands remain far NE.</li>
<li>Data notes: Altimetry, models, and nearshore buoys are missing; upper-air limited. Confidence medium (0.68). Leaning on pressure charts, satellite, and physics-based travel times; verify with NDBC 51101/51001/51003/51004.</li>
</ul>
<h3>North Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wed 10/15: Small. H1/3 <strong>1–2 ft</strong>; H1/10 sets to <strong>3 ft</strong>. Mixed old NNW/WNW crumbs. Light AM trades, cleanest early. </li>
<li>Thu 10/16: Slow rise late. H1/3 <strong>2–3 ft</strong>; sets <strong>4 ft</strong> at 320–340° magnets late PM. Expect more <strong>9–12 s</strong> than long-period energy.</li>
<li>Fri 10/17: Building PM. Morning <strong>2–3 ft</strong>; late-day H1/3 <strong>3–5 ft</strong> at best NW exposures; H1/10 sets <strong>6–7 ft</strong> faces. First <strong>14–16 s</strong> NNW forerunners possible by evening. Wind E–ENE 10–20 kt, side/off for many lineups; bump increases PM.</li>
<li>Key spots: Early-season reefs with NW window favor the near-field pulse. Northerly-leaning, shadowed spots smaller. Watch outer buoys 51001/51101 for the pulse timing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>West Side</h3>
<ul>
<li>Similar trend, a notch under the North Shore for NNW; near-field NW has better angle. </li>
<li>Wed: <strong>1–2 ft</strong>. Thu: <strong>2–3 ft</strong>. Fri PM: <strong>3–4 ft</strong>, sets <strong>5–6 ft</strong> at standouts like Makaha late.</li>
<li>Trades side-on in the afternoons; best early.</li>
</ul>
<h3>South Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wed–Thu: Holding small but rideable at focal reefs. H1/3 1.5–2.<strong>5 ft</strong>; inconsistent <strong>3–4 ft</strong> faces on the better sets.</li>
<li>Fri: Gradual ease; more inconsistent. </li>
<li>Winds: Morning land-breeze glass possible; light-moderate trades bring texture by late morning. Buoy 51004 shows small <strong>14–16 s</strong> background; no significant reinforcements during the window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>East Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persistent trades. H1/3 <strong>2–4 ft</strong>; H1/10 sets to <strong>5 ft</strong>. Short-period, choppy; best for windsurf/foil. No remote easterly swell source noted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tides/Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate diurnal swings; evening lows near 0.<strong>2 ft</strong> (NOAA 1612340). Latest obs 1.<strong>57 ft</strong> at 2312 HST 10/15. Plan for slower water movement mid-mornings, more push on mid-day highs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sat 10/18: Continued build from the near-field NW overnight keeps North Shore in the moderate band early, with the first real <strong>14–16 s</strong> NNW lines filling late day. </li>
<li>Sun 10/19: Primary NNW from the Gulf low fills in. Expect H1/3 trending <strong>4–6 ft</strong> at 330–350° magnets; H1/10 <strong>6–8 ft</strong> faces, possibly higher if 51101 spikes &gt;<strong>3 ft</strong> at <strong>15–17 s</strong> (pressure chart had <strong>6–9 ft</strong> H1/3 potential; hedging lower until buoys confirm). Physics: <strong>4 ft</strong> @ 14 s arrival window supports the morning ramp.</li>
<li>Mon 10/20: NNW holds with a WNW blend from the dateline/Kamchatka side (physics <strong>3 ft</strong> @ 11 s). Maintain moderate surf with mixed periods. </li>
<li>Trades persist; no tropical threats (TWOCP: none 7 days).</li>
</ul>
<p>Buoy references: 51101/51001 (NW/NNW long-period), 51003 (WNW), 51004 (S), 51211/51212 (E trades). Gaps: altimetry/models/nearshore not available; updates may adjust size/timing once outer buoys show forerunners.</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Dominant NW (307°) mid-period swell in the mix: buoys show a sharp 14.<strong>4 ft</strong> H1/3 at 14 s with H1/10 to ~18.<strong>8 ft</strong> late Wed 10/15; that pencils out to roughly <strong>22–26 ft</strong> faces on the most exposed outer reefs for the bulk of sets (H1/3) with occasional <strong>30–34 ft</strong> faces on the biggest 1/10 waves, in a brief window centered Wed evening through early Thu, then trending down through Thu and Fri. A smaller Aleutian NW reinforcement near <strong>5 ft</strong> at 13 s is due late Fri evening, nudging the surf back up after dark.</p>
<p>Wind and tide: Light to moderate ENE trades near 5–12 kt favor early sessions with side-off to offshore flow for many North Shore reefs; expect rising texture and some wind bump by midday, easing toward sunset. Evening lows are on the small side (~0–0.<strong>3 ft</strong> reported Wed), which will make Pipe/Ehukai extra shallow and ledgy and speed up channels at Sunset; mid-morning to midday higher tides will soften the heaviest reefs and improve entry/exit. Tidal details beyond Wed are incomplete, so treat exact tide windows Thu–Fri with moderate uncertainty.</p>
<p>Flagship breaks
- Pipeline/Backdoor (exposure weight moderate to high to 300–320°; less efficient on pure N): Wed PM if the buoy spike verifies, 10–15+ ft faces with occasional <strong>18–20 ft</strong> sets, very heavy and shallow on the evening low; easing Thu from <strong>8–12 ft</strong> AM to <strong>6–10 ft</strong> PM; Fri <strong>5–8 ft</strong> faces with a slight evening tick up. Best early with light E–ENE; lower tide increases risk of step-lipping closeouts.
- Sunset (high exposure, takes NW and N cleanly): Wed PM jumps to outer-reef size, <strong>15–22 ft</strong> faces with plus sets possible; Thu easing from <strong>12–18 ft</strong> AM to <strong>10–15 ft</strong> PM; Fri <strong>8–12 ft</strong> AM, holding or nudging up late with the 13 s reinforcement. Trades are quartering offshore; channels will be swift on the evening lows.
- Waimea (needs size, prefers NW–N mix): If the NW/N buoy spike translates nearshore, Waimea can turn on late Wed into early Thu with <strong>18–22 ft</strong> faces on the larger sets, then easing below threshold by Thu PM; Fri likely below breaking most of the day. Confidence lower here given the brevity of the buoy peak; plan for rapid changes and long lulls.</p>
<p>Buoy evidence and exposure notes
- Primary driver is the NW 307° at 14 s, exposure weight ~0.82, so the best-open reefs (Sunset, outer reefs, Waimea Bay exposure) take the brunt.
- Secondary N energy 350–354° at 13 s (exposure ~0.50) adds set variability and favors more northerly-facing reefs (Sunset, Lani’s) while being less efficient at Pipe/Backdoor.
- W 268° and S 186° energy showing on buoys has little direct impact on the North Shore due to shadowing.</p>
<p>Hazards
- With outer-reef faces reaching the <strong>20–30 ft</strong> tier during the Wed night/early Thu window, expect powerful rip currents, long-period surges, wide wash-throughs on reefs, and harbor surging. Shorebreak will be hazardous near low tide, especially around Ehukai/Pupukea.</p>
<p>Trend through the period
- Wed 10/15: Rapid evening rise to extra-large on best exposures if the buoy spike holds; heavy, uneven sets with a north tilt in the mix.
- Thu 10/16: Down but still solid in the morning; steady fade through the day.
- Fri 10/17: Smaller morning surf; slight evening bump as <strong>5 ft</strong> @ 13 s NW arrives, more noticeable after dark and into Saturday.</p>
<p>Confidence: Medium (0.68). Buoy coverage is good (14/17) and supports the NW/N mix, but the extreme NW reading is a narrow-time spike and key feeds are missing (no altimetry, no nearshore buoy/model guidance, no upper-air), so nearshore translation and Waimea thresholds carry moderate uncertainty. Trades and tide interplay are broadly favorable for mornings; precise tide windows Thu–Fri are less certain.</p>

        <div class="forecast-section shore-forecast">
            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>South Shore forecast (O‘ahu): Wed Oct 15 – Fri Oct 17, 2025</p>
<p>1) Opening assessment: size, direction, timing
- Primary source: background southern hemi S to SSSW lines near 180–190° at 14s early Wednesday, easing through the period. No new southern reinforcements within the 3-day window.
- Wrap: long-period W–NW energy in the broader basin is significant for the North/West shores but has low wrap efficiency into Town; only slight late-week influence for the far SW exposures (Barbers/Ewa).
- Expected breaker heights (Hawaiian scale, H1/3) with H1/10 set estimates:
  - Wed 10/15: 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong> H1/3, sets to 2.<strong>5–3 ft</strong> H1/10 at the top S-facing magnets early; easing late.
  - Thu 10/16: <strong>1–2 ft</strong> H1/3, sets to 2–2.<strong>5 ft</strong> H1/10; more inconsistent as period trims toward <strong>12–13s</strong>.
  - Fri 10/17: <strong>1 ft</strong> H1/3, occasional 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong> H1/10 at best reefs; late-day tiny W wrap possible for Barbers/Ewa, not meaningful for Town.</p>
<p>2) Town vs. outlier breaks; tides and winds
- Ala Moana/Kewalos/Bowls:
  - Directional fit: The 180–190° band lines up best for Bowls/Kewalos; the 14s energy favors refraction into the deeper Town channels, but with long lulls.
  - Expect the largest sets here each morning: Wed dawn the best window for waist-chest peaks (H1/10 to <strong>3 ft</strong>), easing to knee-thigh by Fri with infrequent pluses.
  - Tides: Midday higher water will soften the small surf; the evening lower tide near Wed’s 0.<strong>2 ft</strong> low (around 7 PM) gives a bit more push on the reefs. Expect the evening lows to shift later each day.
  - Winds: Trades trending E–ENE. Light to gentle early (around 5–10 kt; PHNL 07009 at 0853Z), building mid-late morning to moderate. Cleanest 6–9 AM; texture after mid-morning.
- Waikiki:
  - More shadowing and slower reefs: 0.5–1.<strong>5 ft</strong> Wed–Thu with rare thigh-high pulses; down a notch Fri. Best on logs or big fish. High tide will bog it; aim for lower tide windows near sunset for a little extra push.
- Diamond Head:
  - Exposure and wind: Picks up the S lines but sits more open to the trades; expect sideshore bump as winds rise. Size similar to Town Wed (knee-waist with a few pluses), trending down. Early morning is key before the trades return; mid-day will be textured to choppy.
- Outliers (wrap potential):
  - Barbers/Ewa: Minimal, late-week contribution from long-period W–NW energy may add knee-high, inconsistent wrap late Fri. Town reefs remain largely shadowed from the NW events; no meaningful help there.</p>
<p>3) Board call and crowd/consistency
- Consistency: Long-period background pulses mean pronounced lulls—12–18 minutes between the better sets, longest on Thu–Fri.
- Best craft:
  - Wed: Longboards and high-volume shortboards at the magnets; competent shortboards can sample the larger sets at Bowls/Kewalos early.
  - Thu–Fri: Logs and mid-lengths rule. Groveler fish for the magnets; standard shortboards will be underfed.
- Crowds: Typical Town shoulder seasons—peaks draw a pack during the morning glass. The fading trend should thin it some by Fri, but magnets will still be competitive for the few set waves.</p>
<p>4) Background pulses, wrap specifics, and local wind/reef nuances
- Southern hemi background: The 14s S pulse peaking early Wed is the tail of the fall run; decay expected ~0.<strong>5 ft</strong>/day with gradual period shortening. No fresh fetch signals in the southern belt for the 72-hr window.
- Wrap mechanics: The notable NW/N energy in the basin (buoy indications to <strong>14–15s</strong>) directs at winter shores. With O‘ahu’s geometry and island blocking, Town doesn’t see this; only far SW corners (Barbers/Ewa) might feel a tiny, late Fri knee-high whisper via diffraction/refraction.
- Winds: E–ENE trade regime favors early glass for Town, then moderate sideshore at Diamond Head and light cross/off for Ala Moana. Quality index 0.46 reflects the modest trades texture and small surf.
- Tides: Evening lows assist small-surf draw on shallow reefs; midday highs slow it, especially inside Waikiki.</p>
<p>5) Confidence statement
- Overall confidence: Medium (0.68). Charts, satellite, buoys, and climatology align on a fading S background with no new southern reinforcements. That said, several feeds are missing (altimetry, nearshore buoys, upper-air, and model guidance), and one deep-water S reading appears inflated relative to recent local response—so sizes lean conservative and weighted toward observed Town behavior in October. Expect minor day-to-day adjustments tied to trade strength and tide timing rather than new swell.</p>
<p>Bottom line
- Wed: Best of the run. Town magnets 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong> H1/3, sets to 2.<strong>5–3 ft</strong> early; clean AM with long lulls.
- Thu: Down a notch. <strong>1–2 ft</strong> with rare 2+ ft sets at magnets; more inconsistent; morning glass.
- Fri: Smallest. Around <strong>1 ft</strong> with infrequent 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong> sets; logs/mids. Tiny late-day W wrap for Barbers; negligible for Town.</p>

        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>HEADLINE: XL long-period NW–N swell is the story—expert-only North/West; trades favor cleaner South early.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE: <strong>12–18 ft</strong> faces, sets 20–25+ at outer reefs from NW–N (307–354° @ <strong>13–14s</strong>). Best window: first light to mid-morning at leeward/corner reefs before trades and warble; otherwise powerful, chaotic surf with strong outflow currents.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE: Head high to well overhead (<strong>4–8 ft</strong> faces) with occasional larger long-period sets from S (186° @ 14s). Best window: dawn through mid-morning with light offshore trades; slower, long lulls—watch for sneaky sets.</p>
<h3>East/West:</h3>
<ul>
<li>WEST: Large W–NW wrap (268–307° @ 14s): <strong>8–15 ft</strong> faces, plus larger sets at magnets (Makaha and outer reefs). Early is best; strong currents and wide wash-throughs.</li>
<li>EAST: Trade-chopped and mixed wrap. Windward reefs waist to head high; bigger near Kahuku from N wrap but bumpy under trades.</li>
</ul>
<p>WINDS: ENE trades around 9 kt early, trending moderate by late morning. Quality: side-on to side/off for many North Shore breaks (bumpy except at protected corners), offshore for much of Town and parts of the West Side—cleanest early. Expect increasing texture through midday.</p>
<h3>Tides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low: ~7:05–7:07 PM HST near 0.<strong>2 ft</strong>.</li>
<li>Latest obs (Honolulu 1612340) ~11:12 PM: 1.<strong>57 ft</strong>.
Plan around a lower evening tide; morning sits mid-level—more reef clearance early than late.</li>
</ul>
<p>HAZARDS: Long-period, powerful sets with long lulls; strong rip/longshore currents; wide wrap and shorebreak on West; harbor surges possible on exposed entries. Expert-only North/West.</p>
<p>ACTION ITEM: Go early. North/West only for experts with proper equipment and safety support; otherwise target South Shore reefs at dawn for the cleanest, most manageable surf before trades pick up.</p>
