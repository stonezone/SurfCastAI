### Summary
- Dominant swell: Long-period NW (310–335°) forerunners Wednesday build to a Thursday peak, easing Friday. Expect H1/3 **6–9 ft** on the North Shore at the peak with H1/10 set faces **10–14 ft** at the most open reefs.
- Winds: E–ENE trades near 15–20 kt (gusty afternoons) keep windward sides rough; leeward/N shore mornings offer the cleanest windows.
- Confidence: Medium (0.64). Amplitude hinges on the storm’s aim; sideband geometry favors N–NNW components over square-on WNW.

### Details
- Storm/pressure setting: A 970 mb low near 46N 172W is sliding ENE against a 1027 mb high near 40N 145W, creating a broad, long-duration WNW–NW fetch aimed 310–335° into Hawai‘i. Hurricane-force sectors on the E/S quadrants improved fetch quality. A weaker, occluded WNW source west of the Dateline trails behind.
- Satellite context: GOES-West shows the strongest gradients oriented mainly into the Pacific Northwest; Hawai‘i sits on the SW flank—classic sideband N–NNW/NW delivery rather than a square WNW bullseye. Expect long-period forerunners with some directional spread and lulls.
- Buoy evidence: The swell matrix flags large deepwater NW components Tue (e.g., 17.**1 ft** @16 s from 322°, 16.**4 ft** @14 s from 308–309°, 12.**5 ft** @16 s from 326°; significance up to 0.78). Treat these as upstream/outer-buoy signals translating to O‘ahu surf in the **6–9 ft** H1/3 range at peak for open NW exposures. Monitor NDBC 51101/51001 for period/turn and CDIP 225 Hanalei, 106 Waimea for coastal response.
- Trades/windswell: Persistent 1019–1021 mb ridge lobes keep ENE trades 15–20 kt. Expect **7–9 s** ENE windswell H1/3 **2–3 ft**, H1/10 to **3–5 ft** on E shores (CDIP 249 Pauwela).
- South swell: A broad SPAC westerly belt suggests a low, long-period SSW background. Expect H1/3 1.5–2.**5 ft** with infrequent H1/10 sets to **3–4 ft** faces at SSW magnets; long lulls. Watch NDBC 51004 and CDIP 239 Barbers for **16–17 s** lines.
- Tides: Tide table coverage for the exact window is limited in the digest. Latest Honolulu obs was 2.**04 ft** at 14:00 Tue. Plan around modest mid-day highs and lower evening tides; verify with NOAA 1612340.

### North Shore
- Wed Oct 15: Forerunners fill through the day. Morning modest (H1/3 **2–4 ft**) building to **4–6 ft** by late PM at NW magnets. Infrequent H1/10 sets to **7–9 ft** faces as the **16–18 s** energy lands. E–ENE trades 15–20 kt are side-offshore to offshore for many NS spots; morning best.
- Thu Oct 16 (peak): H1/3 **6–9 ft** at open NW exposures from 310–335°, with H1/10 sets **10–14 ft** on the outer reefs. Long-period sets run wide; shadowed or blocked spots trend lower. Directional mix favors N–NNW standouts (Lani’s, Sunset) more than pure W exposures. Trades moderate-fresh; cleanest early with rising bump by late morning.
- Fri Oct 17: Downshift. H1/3 **4–6 ft** with H1/10 sets **7–9 ft** early, easing further late. Period shortens to **14–16 s**. Any late WNW reinforcement looks minor within the day. Continued trades; morning edges it.

### South Shore
- Oct 15–17: Background SSW only. H1/3 1.5–2.**5 ft** at magnets with occasional H1/10 sets **3–4 ft** faces; long waits. Trades bring texture by late morning; dawn best. Barbers 239 should show the long-period tail if any small pulses sneak in.

### East And Windward
- Oct 15–17: ENE windswell steady to slight up. H1/3 **2–3 ft** with choppy H1/10 sets to **3–5 ft** on the most open exposures. Local winds dominate quality; brief dawn lulls possible.

### Outlook
- Sat Oct 18–Sun Oct 19: Physics-based guidance adds a new N–NW mix: Gulf low **5 ft**@13 s late Sat morning and Aleutian **4 ft**@14 s Sat night in deep water. Translation to surf: potential rebuild late Sat into Sun in the head-high zone (H1/3 ~**4–6 ft**) at best exposures if shadowing is modest, with sets a notch higher. Confidence 70–75% on timing, moderate on amplitude.
- Trades persist under the mid-latitude ridge; no tropical systems expected next 7 days per CPHC/NHC. South shore stays minimal with background pulses only.
- Buoys to watch: 51101/51001 for next forerunners; CDIP 106/225 to time peak/decay; 239 Barbers for any SSW sleepers.

Data gaps: Exposure weights n/a; tide specifics for 10/15–17 limited. Overall forecast confidence: medium (0.64).

## North Shore Forecast

North Shore (Oct 15–17): A powerful, long‑period NW pulse (primary 322°) that spiked at the buoys Tue afternoon to 17.**1 ft** H1/3 with upper‑decile sets near **22 ft** H1/10 is the dominant driver; exposure weights are near full (0.99–0.96) for WNW–NW reefs. Expect a dawn peak Wednesday 10/15 with gradual easing Thursday 10/16 and more fade Friday 10/17, as the **14–16 s** energy settles and secondary mid‑period NW fills in behind.

Wind/tide interplay: Trades from the E to ENE around 15–20 kt (PHNL 080° at 16 kt, gusts to 23) favor side‑ to offshore grooming on the North Shore, especially at reefs with some east wind blockage; expect midday bump where the coast bends. Residual NE windswell (**8–10 s**, exposure weight ~0.5) adds texture rather than size. Tides are in a moderate range with near‑**2 ft** daytime highs; higher water enhances surges/backwash in bays (e.g., Waimea, Pipe) and reduces channel relief during the biggest sets Wednesday. Quality index sits mid‑pack (0.58): best windows are early before trades freshen and before the higher tide.

Buoy evidence and exposure notes:
- Primary long‑period NW: 17.**1 ft** @ 16 s from 322° (H1/3), H1/10 ≈ **22 ft**; exposure weight 0.99 (fully open). Secondary NW packets **14–16 s** (308–326°) 11.8–16.**4 ft** with high exposure (0.83–0.96) keep sets stacked.
- Minor contributors: WNW 292° **6–7 ft** @ 15 s and NE 8 s wrap. The NE component carries only partial exposure (0.5) and is a quality factor more than a height maker.

Flagship breaks:
- Waimea Bay
  - Wed 10/15: **20–30 ft** faces, occasional **35–40 ft** on the bombs as the 16 s peak translates; heavy surges on higher tides; long, powerful rips. Only for experts with skis.
  - Thu 10/16: Easing to **12–18 ft** faces early, occasional **20 ft**; still strong currents; improving organization with less overlap.
  - Fri 10/17: **8–12 ft** faces, occasionally **14 ft** early; below warning, trending advisory to below-advisory by late day.
- Sunset Beach
  - Wed 10/15: **18–25 ft** faces, sets to near 30; long walls, strong northward sweep; side‑off grooming from trades but still warbly between sets.
  - Thu 10/16: **12–18 ft**, sets to 20 early; cleaner windows AM; currents remain strong.
  - Fri 10/17: **8–12 ft**, sets to 14; more open to crowd and rips manageable but present.
- Pipeline/Backdoor
  - Wed 10/15: Mostly maxed/2nd reef; **15–25 ft** faces with long‑interval closeouts on 1st reef; surgy at higher tide; expert‑only.
  - Thu 10/16: **8–12 ft** faces early, 6–10 later; improved makeability as the period and size step down; still some east‑wind texture.
  - Fri 10/17: **6–10 ft** faces; best shape early with side‑off trades; more consistent Backdoor if the angle trends a touch west in the mid‑period mix.
- Hale‘iwa/Laniakea (added for reference)
  - Wed 10/15: **12–18 ft** faces at outer reefs; heavy sweeps; selective.
  - Thu 10/16: **8–12 ft**; improved organization.
  - Fri 10/17: **6–10 ft**; fun zones with morning groom.

Hazards: Conditions Wednesday are likely at or above High Surf Warning thresholds for north exposures. Expect life‑threatening rip currents, powerful longshore drift, wash‑throughs on outer reefs, bay surges (Waimea), and occasional coastal run‑up on higher tides. Thursday eases but remains at least advisory early; hazards persist into Friday morning though diminishing.

Confidence: Medium (0.64). Buoy coverage is strong (12/13) with coherent spectral support at **14–16 s** from 308–326° and high exposure weights on the primary NW components, so confidence is higher on the size/trend through Thursday. Confidence is lower on break‑by‑break surf numbers and day‑to‑day wind/tide effects given moderate trades, partial NE windswell contamination, and incomplete tide detail for exact turn times. No tropical interference expected. Note: next, smaller mid‑period NWs are modeled to arrive Saturday (**5 ft** @ 13 s, then **4 ft** @ 14 s), outside this forecast window.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore: Oct 15–17, 2025 (Fall wrap-and-background regime)

1) Opening assessment (size, direction, timing)
- Overall: Below seasonal average with no true southern hemi events in the pipe; rideable windows rely on wrap from the XL NNW–NW and a trickle of trade-wind energy to east-exposed outliers.
- Primary energy sources affecting Town:
  - Long-period wrap: NNW–NW 320–330° at **14–16s** leaking into select Town reefs via deep-water refraction/diffraction. Expect only a few percent of deepwater energy to survive the island shadow, yielding occasional sets at the most exposed channels.
  - Trade-wind background: ENE 60–80° at **7–9s**, favoring Diamond Head and other SE-facing outliers.
  - True S–SSW background: Minimal to trace (no active south swell events detected).
- Size guidance (Hawaiian scale, H1/3 with H1/10 for the standout sets):
  - Wed 10/15: Town H1/3 0.5–1.**5 ft**; H1/10 **2 ft** on the best wrap windows. Direction mix: trace S–SSW 180–200° + NNW wrap 320–330° at **14–16s**. Most inconsistent early; best chance late morning to midday as the wrap peaks then eases.
  - Thu 10/16: Town H1/3 0.5–1.**25 ft**; H1/10 1.**5–2 ft** at rare magnets. Wrap fades a notch; trade-wind short-period energy steadies Diamond Head in the waist range at times.
  - Fri 10/17: Town H1/3 0.**5–1 ft**; H1/10 near 1.**5 ft**. Residual wrap only; rely on east-exposed outliers for the most rideable waves.

2) Town vs. outlier breaks (winds and tides)
- Ala Moana/Kewalos/Kaisers (Town reefs):
  - Best shot at the long-period NNW wrap via deep channels. With deepwater NW in the teens and **14–16s** periods, refraction coefficients into Town sit roughly 0.03–0.08; translation: long lulls, then a set or two can pop waist-high, rarely plus. Expect the most energy midday Wed, easing Thu–Fri.
  - Trades (E–ENE 15–20 kt, stronger afternoons) run side-offshore to cross for many Town reefs—cleaner early with land breeze or lighter morning trades, then textured to choppy by late morning onward.
  - Tides: The mid to higher water midday this week will soften already-small lines and may swamp inside sections; early mornings with lower water offer slightly more push and definition on the reef ledges.
- Waikiki:
  - Heavily shadowed from 300–330°; only trace wrap. Most sessions knee to knee-thigh at best, very inconsistent. Tall buildings and headlands can help wind texture somewhat, but size is the limiting factor. Aim early for smooth conditions; expect crowd density to be high for the size.
- Diamond Head (SE exposure/outlier):
  - Most reliable rideable option under trades. Picks up ENE trade-wind swell and any stray E wrap; look for thigh–waist with pulses to waist+ during stronger trade surges, especially Wed–Thu. Trades are grooming/offshore here; expect bump in the channel and some lump on the face, but the reefs handle it well.
  - Tides: Handles a bit more water; still, early sessions are cleaner and peppier before winds peak.

3) Boards, crowd, and consistency
- Boards: Longboards and high-volume fish are the call in Town; shortboards only for the most patient hunters at Bowls/Kewalos during the rare wrap pulses, or for Diamond Head when trades add a little punch. Expect very long lulls between meaningful sets on Town reefs.
- Crowds and rhythm: With limited size and few takeoff zones, magnets will be packed. Efficiency goes to paddlers who can sit on the channels that focus the wrap and are willing to wait through multi-minute lulls. Diamond Head spreads crowds better but stays busy under steady trades.

4) Confidence statement
- Confidence: Medium (0.64). Buoy coverage is strong (12/13), charts/metar/satellite complete, and nine swell events detected—none aimed S–SSW. The forecast hinges on well-understood refraction from XL NNW–NW energy and persistent trades. Expect small day-to-day variance tied to wind strength and tide timing more than swell production.

Heads-up beyond the window
- Additional mid-period NW pulses from the Gulf of Alaska/Aleutians are modeled to arrive Sat 10/18 (**5 ft** @ 13s and **4 ft** @ 14s). Directly, they target the North/West shores; indirectly, they may keep a trickle of long-period wrap alive for Town next weekend—but still minor for true south-facing breaks.

Bottom line
- Wed: Best of the bunch for Town wrap; 0.5–1.**5 ft** H1/3 with rare **2 ft** H1/10 sets at select channels; trades moderate-fresh—early is cleanest. DH offers the steadiest rideability via trade swell.
- Thu: Wrap eases; rely more on DH. Town inconsistent, mostly knee-thigh with the odd waist set.
- Fri: Minimal leftovers; longboard-only most places in Town; DH remains the safer bet for waist-ish windswell lines under trades.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: XL NW/NNW swell holds but eases through the day; best bet is dawn on the West Side with trades ramping mid-morning.

NORTH SHORE: **15–25 ft** faces, occasional 30+ early at outer reefs, easing PM; direction NW–NNW (300–330°) long-period **14–16s**; best window first light before trades pick up and while tide is mid.

SOUTH SHORE: **1–2 ft** with inconsistent NW wrap to **3 ft** at top SW magnets; best at dawn with lightest winds; otherwise small and textured.

### East/West:
- WEST: **12–18 ft** faces, sets to **20–22 ft** at deepwater magnets early; cleaner with E trades (offshore); best window dawn to mid-morning, easing late.
- EAST: **5–8 ft** faces, short-period NE/E windswell plus wrap; very rough and windblown; best avoided unless for wind/safety training.

WINDS: Trades from the E–ENE around 15–25 kt (gusts to low 20s). Lightest and most organized at daybreak; bump builds mid/late morning. Side/onshore for many North Shore breaks, offshore for West exposures, onshore and rough windward, lightest for Town early.

TIDES (Honolulu approx; check live):
- Late-morning high near 2.**0 ft** (~11:30 AM HST).
- Evening low near 0.**3 ft** (~7:45–8:00 PM HST).
Note: XL sets will produce strong shorebreak and run-up around the late-morning high.

ACTION ITEM: Go early and go West if you want quality; North is for experts only with heavy currents and wash-throughs. Avoid windward unless you’re chasing chop. Use the dawn window, then reassess as trades and dropping swell shift conditions. Medium confidence.
