Background NE/N energy (matrix-detected 6.2 ft H1/3 @10\u201311 s) is present as residuals but was sampled earlier (windows centered 10/10) and should be fading through 10/13\u201310/15. East/South exposure will be governed by local ESE trades and small S/SSE pulses \u2014 wind chop likely. Forecast confidence: 0.6 / 1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- Aleutian / NW pulse \u2014 arrival and amplitude: physics-based propagation predicts a 6 ft H1/3 @13 s arrival 2025-10-14 03:40 HST (travel-time estimate provided in digest). H1/10 ~8.1 ft (use 1.35\u00d7 H1/3 as working conversion). Monitor buoys 51001 and 46089 for approach and 51002/near-Hawaii buoys for final confirmation. Expect long-period, well-organized sets if the fetch maintains coherence; the 1035 mb high north of Hawaii could partially shadow/refraction-attenuate energy \u2014 monitor for model changes.\n- Residual NE / N energy \u2014 matrix entries: multiple NE/N entries in the swell matrix show 6.2 ft H1/3 @10\u201311 s (source: buoy, windows centered 2025-10-10). These are the earlier swell trains that will be in decay mode across our 10/13\u201310/15 window; they still contribute to the north-leaning energy field and may prolong rideable conditions ahead of the Aleutian pulse.\n- ESE / S / SSE components: ESE 5.6 ft H1/3 @9 s (H1/10 ~7.3 ft) and smaller S/SSE 3.0\u20132.3 ft @11\u201312 s are present in the matrix (window 10/10). These are shorter-period, more wind-affected arrivals; they make south and east exposures inconsistent and add chop when trades strengthen.\n- Buoy guidance / monitoring: primary buoys to watch for verification and real-time period/dir changes \u2014 51001, 51002, 46089, 46026. Matrix entries flagged only as \u201cbuoy\u201d \u2014 exposure weights unavailable in the digest; treat heights as basin-scale indicators rather than exact break-level predictions.\n- Tides & obs: NOAA tide station 1612340 latest sea-level obs 2025-10-11 00:00 HST = 0.45 ft. Full local tide table for 10/13\u201310/15 not in digest (marking as n/a) \u2014 check NOAA station 1612340 before sessions for exact high/low times.\n\nNORTH SHORE (O\u02bbahu)\n- Key breaks: Waimea, Ehukai (Pipeline/Banzai), Sunset Beach, Hale\u02bbiwa.\n- Oct 13: Oceanside will be dominated by fading NE/N residuals \u2014 expect smaller, inconsistent north sets. H1/3 from residuals trending down; treat matrix 6.2 ft H1/3 as decaying source rather than fresh energy. Confidence moderate; data shows window centered 10/10.\n- Oct 14 (predawn \u2192 morning): The Aleutian 6 ft H1/3 @13 s pulse is expected to arrive 03:40 HST and raise north-facing exposures. Expect longer-period, powerful sets \u2014 H1/10 set faces in the upper single digits to low double digits at the most exposed reefs/points if the pulse arrives as modeled (H1/10 \u2248 8 ft as base; reef amplification can push faces larger). Conditions likely cleaner on the early ebb before trades/storm-related wind swings kick in. Confidence moderate \u2014 outcome sensitive to 1035 mb high position and buoy confirmations.\n- Oct 15: Decay phase \u2014 sets drop back toward residual levels, still surfable at priority north points but less consistent. Tidal windows matter \u2014 heavier reef breaks prefer mid\u2192low tide for steep, punchy faces; check NOAA tide station 1612340 for exact timing. Overall confidence 0.6; note static chart limitations and lack of live spectra in the packet.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (O\u02bbahu)\n- Key breaks: Waikiki, Ala Moana, Kewalos, south-point reef windows.\n- General: South swell season is winding down \u2014 matrix shows modest ESE/S/SSE energy (ESE 5.6 ft @9 s; S 3.0 ft @12 s), but these are short-to-mid period and wind-affected. Expect chest-to-head-high sets at exposed south reefs on peak windows, with inconsistent ride quality on beach breaks.\n- Oct 13\u201315 specifics: small, wind-dependent south-swell pulses and trades will dominate. ESE component may give knee-to-chest-high occasional sets at Waikiki; H1/3 numbers from the matrix (5.6 ft ESE) are basin-sampled \u2014 expect smaller, variable local faces (H1/10 ~7.3 ft at exposed reefs is an upper basin indicator; actual south beach faces typically lower). Trades will produce short-period chop on windward shores and can make east/south exposures messy \u2014 watch local wind forecasts and buoy 51002 for nearshore confirmation.\n- Confidence lower for exact set sizes because exposure amplification and local wind/time-of-tide interplay are not resolved in the digest.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 10/15, 1\u20134 days)\n- 10/16: Gulf Alaska pulse predicted (physics digest) \u2014 5 ft @10 s arrival 10/16 06:58 HST (distance 929 nm, travel-time ~2.5 days). Expect additional N/NW energy \u2014 shorter period than Aleutian pulse but could reinforce north exposures into 10/16\u201310/17. Monitor buoys 46089 / 51001 for confirmation.\n- 10/17\u201310/18: Longer-range Aleutian remnant predicted (4 ft @11 s arriving 10/18) \u2014 expect gradual decay but elevated north-northwest background through the period. The 978\u2013966 mb storm complex north of the islands (pressure analysis) could produce stronger follow-up NW energy in the 3\u20136 day window if the frontal fetch stays exposed and the 1035 mb high shifts east/weakens. If the high stays parked between source and islands, expect trade-dominated messy conditions instead.\n- Tactical: if planning big north sessions mid-late next week, monitor buoy spectra (51001/51002/46089/46026) and model runs (WW3/GFS/ECMWF) 48\u201372 hrs out \u2014 the arrival/cleanliness hinge on high-pressure position and fetch continuity. Data gaps: static charts and absence of live buoy spectra in the packet reduce timing/height confidence \u2014 real-time buoy reads will be decisive.\n\nNotes / Data caveats\n- Digest confidence: medium (0.64/1.00). Most upstream charts were static snapshots; no live buoy time series or model animations included in packet \u2014 this increases arrival-peak timing uncertainty. Matrix sources flagged generically as \"buoy\"; exposure weighting was not available.\n- Buoys to watch now: 51001, 51002, 46089, 46026 (use these for incoming period confirmation and Hs trends). Check local wind/METARs (PHNL) and NOAA tide station 1612340 before heading out.\n- Forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0 \u2014 solid synoptic signals for NW energy exist, but the strong high north of Hawaii and lack of live spectra raise conditional uncertainty.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll fetch live spectral reads from the four buoys, run per-break H1/3\u2192H1/10 conversions for Waimea / Sunset / Pipeline / Waikiki and push a refined arrival timeline with tide windows for O\u02bbahu.",
  "north_shore": "Dominant swell: through the 13th\u201315th the North Shore will be governed by lingering NE/N energy measured at buoy stations \u2014 6.2 ft H1/3 (roughly 8.1 ft H1/10 estimate) from the NE/N with the measured windows centered on 2025\u201110\u201110. Add to that a modeled Aleutian pulse (6 ft @ 13 s) expected to arrive early Oct 14 (~03:40 HST) \u2014 that pulse is the wildcard that will lift sizes and add longer\u2011period, more powerful NW energy into the 14th and into the 15th peak period.\n\nWind / tide interplay (short and practical)\n- Buoy and METAR reports show very light winds at the moment (PHNL VRB03 kt). Light morning winds will generally give clean lines on most reefs; typical fall pattern is for tradewind/sea\u2011breezes to reestablish in the afternoons, which will make the best surf windows the mornings and early forenoons.  \n- Tidal range is modest right now; reef breaks on the North Shore will respond strongly to small tide changes \u2014 lower tides tend to expose reefs and hollow the waves (better barrels at Pipeline and Sunset), while higher tides can make peaks pushy and fat. Check the local tide table before you paddle out; small timing differences will change whether a break barrels or just pushes.\n\nFlagship break guidance (what to expect, H1/3 \u2192 H1/10 est, conditions and skill)\n- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai): expect a jump from small/clean on the 13th to much heavier, more hollow sets on the 14th as the Aleutian pulse arrives. Forecast face: roughly 6\u201310 ft H1/3 (\u2248 8\u201312 ft H1/10 est) at the pulse peak \u2014 fast, hollow and expert\u2011only. Morning offshore/very light winds will produce the cleanest barrels; afternoon seabreezes will make it pushy and blown out. Moderate confidence on exact peak timing.\n- Sunset Beach: will react to both the NE residual and the incoming NW pulse \u2014 expect head\u2011high to overhead faces at peak on the 14th (similar H1/3 range to Pipeline but a touch more push and longer rides). Best on mid to incoming tides; expect bigger sets at dawn when winds are light. Strong currents and big hold\u2011downs are likely on sets \u2014 experienced surfers only.\n- Waimea Bay: still marginal for a true big\u2011wave day with current measured energy, but the Aleutian pulse could produce notable increases in north\u2011facing groundswells late on the 14th. Expect shoulder\u2011to-head high faces with occasional bigger sets if the modeled 6 ft @13 s holds and rides into the canyon \u2014 skill and caution required for any run\u2011outs. Confidence for Waimea turning into a proper big\u2011wave day is lower (30\u201350%).\n- Haleiwa / Rocky Point: good all\u2011rounder to test size \u2014 expect waist\u2011to\u2011head high on the 13th, stepping up to head\u2011high+ on the 14th. Cleaner in the mornings; watch the jumbled period mix as NE and incoming NW energy interfere.\n\nHazards\n- No broad government advisories flagged in the ingest, but expect hazardous conditions on the 14th if the Aleutian pulse verifies: strong shore rips, powerful currents, big shorebreaks and long hold\u2011downs at reef passes. Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea will produce serious impact zones \u2014 if you\u2019re not experienced and mentally prepared for heavy wipeouts and long holds, sit it out. Always monitor local lifeguard and buoy cams.\n\nData confidence / uncertainties\n- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence 0.64). Buoy coverage is good (12/13 successful), charts and other sources are available, but the North Shore quality index is modest (0.41) and several key swell components are from a few buoys with exposure weights around 0.50. The Aleutian pulse arrival (Oct 14 ~03:40 HST) has ~75% model confidence \u2014 it\u2019s the main uncertainty for the 14th\u201315th forecast. In short: expect a clean, moderate surf window on the 13th, then a likely size/power increase with longer\u2011period NW energy on the 14th; exact peak heights and which breaks go heavy depend on how that Aleutian energy verifies. Keep checking buoy updates and local cams through the 13th night.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast \u2014 Oct 13 \u2192 Oct 15, 2025\nConfidence: Medium (0.64). Data notes: buoys, charts, METARs and satellite all reporting; 9 detected swell events fused into this brief. South\u2011Shore quality index currently low (0.40) \u2014 energy is present but mixed and not premium.\n\n1) Quick, data\u2011backed opening assessment (size, direction, timing)\n- Primary drivers through the period: residual ESE energy (buoy: 5.6 ft H1/3 @ 9 s) with a background southerly pulse (3.0 ft H1/3 @ 12 s) and smaller SSE energy (2.3 ft @ 11 s).\n- Net expected South Shore levels (Hawaiian spot scale, H1/3): roughly 2.5\u20135.0 ft H1/3 across the three days, with estimated H1/10 peak sets in the 3.5\u20137.5 ft range on the better ESE sets. Expect the ESE component to dominate shorter\u2011period punch; the S/12s component will provide longer, cleaner lines when it hooks into shallow reefs.\n- Timing: energy is already in the water and will persist through Oct 13\u201315. The larger Aleutian pulse modeled to arrive early Oct 14 (6 ft @ 13 s, 03:40 HST) is a north/NNW feature \u2014 it will mainly affect north/east exposures and has only limited wrap potential into true south\u2011facing reefs.\n\n2) Wrap potential, background southern\u2011hemi pulses, and synoptic impact\n- Wrap potential: modest. The dominant swell energy for these days is ESE\u2192S; large NNW/Aleutian energy arriving early Oct 14 could produce some NE/ESE wrapping into east\u2011facing reefs (Diamond Head pocket especially) but expect only a modest directional adjustment \u2014 not a wholesale south\u2011shore size boost. In short: don\u2019t bank on a late\u2011period \u201cwrap\u201d turning a small south swell into something much larger.\n- Southern hemisphere/background pulses: the S 3.0 ft @ 12 s pulse (exposure weight high at 0.96) is the useful long\u2011period ingredient here \u2014 it smooths rides and extends faces for longboarders and retro single\u2011fin sessions. It won\u2019t produce big open\u2011face power, but it raises consistency and gives longer takeoffs on reefy sections.\n- Synoptic/wind impact: latest METAR (PHNL) shows very light, variable winds (~VRB03KT). That pattern is favorable for glassy mornings on the south shore. Model guidance and local climatology through fall suggest light, variable to weak E/NE breezes by midday \u2014 expect clean early sessions and the usual light seabreeze pickup in the afternoons. If trades strengthen unexpectedly, expect chop at exposed points.\n\n3) Town vs. outlier breaks \u2014 spot\u2011specific readouts\nAla Moana / Waikiki (Canoes, Queens, Pops)\n- Expected size: waist high \u2192 chest to head high (2\u20134 ft H1/3) through the window, with the better ESE sets pushing higher at the outer reef passes. H1/10 style peak sets will be noticeably more powerful at the outer peaks.\n- Shape: long, forgiving walls from the S/12s and shorter, punchier lobes from the ESE/9s. Mornings will be cleaner with light winds.\n- Crowd/consistency: very consistent and crowded. Best for longboarders and cruiser\u2011style shortboarders working long lines. Early mornings and just after mid\u2011tide will be the sweetest.\nDiamond Head\n- Expected size: chest \u2192 head\u2011plus on the better ESE sets; when the modeled Aleutian 13 s energy nudges in it could produce a few steeper, more powerful sets at Diamond Head\u2019s east\u2011facing reef, but the wrap is limited.\n- Shape: steeper takeoffs and faster walls \u2014 better for high\u2011performance shortboards. Longer period S/12s will smooth and elongate rides; ESE/9s produce punchier faces.\n- Crowd/consistency: less crowded than Waikiki for experienced shortboarders willing to deal with steeper drops. Best mid\u2011tide to higher.\n\n4) Longboard vs. shortboard suitability and crowd expectations\n- Longboards: favored most days. The background S/12s deliver long, drawn\u2011out faces at Ala Moana and Waikiki Canoes. If you\u2019re on a log, mornings will be easy and rewarding.\n- Shortboards: Diamond Head (and the outer Waikiki peaks on the stronger ESE sets) will offer the steeper, hollowed ribbon rides shortboarders want \u2014 but the opportunity will be intermittent. Expect a lower percentage of quality steep waves than a true north\u2011hemisphere winter pulse would provide.\n- Crowds: Waikiki remains the default destination for consistent, easy waves \u2014 expect heavy morning traffic. Diamond Head will thin out crowds but requires better positioning and quicker reflexes.\n\n5) Tides and timing nuances\n- Current tide gauge shows low recent levels and small range; classic fall timing means mid\u2011tide windows often give the best combination of peel and push on the reefs. For Waikiki/Ala Moana aim for mid to mid\u2011high tides for longest rides; Diamond Head tends to reward mid\u2011to\u2011lower tides for punchier sections when ESE is present. Check local tide table for exact windows on each day.\n\n6) Final practical takeaways\n- Oct 13: Small\u2013moderate south/ESE mix. Best for longboards and cruisers in Waikiki/Ala Moana. Light, variable winds \u2192 clean mornings.\n- Oct 14: Similar base state but watch the Aleutian arrival early in the day (modeled 6 ft @ 13 s) \u2014 expect a modest bump/steepening for east\u2011facing reefs (Diamond Head) but not a large increase for true south exposures. Wind pattern still favors morning glass.\n- Oct 15: Decaying ESE/S energy. Cleaner but smaller; longboarders still have the edge. Shortboarders can score limited, punchy sets at Diamond Head if the smaller ESE component holds.\n\n7) Confidence & caveats\n- Overall confidence medium (0.64). Buoy/obs coverage was good (12/13 buoys reporting; charts and METARs successful), but the South\u2011Shore quality index is only 0.40 \u2014 energy is present but mixed directionally and below premium thresholds. The Aleutian modeled arrival (Oct 14) carries moderate (~75%) confidence in timing/period; its impact on south\u2011facing beaches is limited by geometry and local sheltering.\n- Bottom line: expect a surfable, mostly longboard\u2011friendly south shore run Oct 13\u201315 with intermittent punchier windows for shortboards at Diamond Head and the outer Waikiki passes. Light morning winds will be your ally \u2014 mornings will be the cleanest and most consistent windows.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce spot\u2011by\u2011spot expected face heights (H1/3 / H1/10) for Ala Moana, Canoes, Pops, and Diamond Head for each day,\n- pull exact tide times for Oct 13\u201315 to highlight the best hour windows,\n- or run a quick wind forecast check for the same period.",
  "daily": "HEADLINE: Lingering N/NE energy keeps the North Shore rideable this morning (waist\u2011to\u2011head high at exposed points); light/variable winds \u2014 best to go early.\n\nNORTH SHORE \u2014 faces & direction: North to NE-exposed breaks (Pipeline, Ehukai, Sunset/Velzyland) seeing the most energy; expected faces roughly waist \u2192 head high with occasional bigger sets; best window: early morning through mid\u2011morning (cleanest conditions before winds/sea breeze pick up). \n\nSOUTH SHORE \u2014 faces & direction: South/SSE exposures largely small \u2014 knee to thigh at most spots, a few protected points rideable for longboards; best window: mid\u2011tide daylight hours if you want softer, more consistent walls.\n\nEAST / WEST \u2014 quick hits:\n- East (Kailua/Waimanalo): light E/ENE energy \u2014 small but glassy in the morning on light winds; good for SUP/longboard.\n- West (Yokohama/North Shore west-facing coves): generally small and wind-sensitive \u2014 expect weak, choppy conditions later in the day.\n\nWINDS: METAR shows very light, variable winds (~VRB 3 kt at PHNL) \u2014 translates to glassy conditions on most exposures early.
