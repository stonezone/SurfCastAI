### Summary
Dominant pulse: an Aleutian-sourced NW groundswell (**6 ft** H1/3 @ ~13 s) predicted to arrive early 10/14 (03:40 HST), building North Shore exposure into the predawn hours. Background NE/N energy (matrix-detected 6.**2 ft** H1/3 @**10–11 s**) is present as residuals but was sampled earlier (windows centered 10/10) and should be fading through 10/13–10/15. East/South exposure will be governed by local ESE trades and small S/SSE pulses — wind chop likely. Forecast confidence: 0.6 / 1.0.

### Details
- Aleutian / NW pulse — arrival and amplitude: physics-based propagation predicts a **6 ft** H1/3 @13 s arrival 2025-10-14 03:40 HST (travel-time estimate provided in digest). H1/10 ~8.**1 ft** (use 1.35× H1/3 as working conversion). Monitor buoys 51001 and 46089 for approach and 51002/near-Hawaii buoys for final confirmation. Expect long-period, well-organized sets if the fetch maintains coherence; the 1035 mb high north of Hawaii could partially shadow/refraction-attenuate energy — monitor for model changes.
- Residual NE / N energy — matrix entries: multiple NE/N entries in the swell matrix show 6.**2 ft** H1/3 @**10–11 s** (source: buoy, windows centered 2025-10-10). These are the earlier swell trains that will be in decay mode across our 10/13–10/15 window; they still contribute to the north-leaning energy field and may prolong rideable conditions ahead of the Aleutian pulse.
- ESE / S / SSE components: ESE 5.**6 ft** H1/3 @9 s (H1/10 ~7.**3 ft**) and smaller S/SSE 3.0–2.**3 ft** @**11–12 s** are present in the matrix (window 10/10). These are shorter-period, more wind-affected arrivals; they make south and east exposures inconsistent and add chop when trades strengthen.
- Buoy guidance / monitoring: primary buoys to watch for verification and real-time period/dir changes — 51001, 51002, 46089, 46026. Matrix entries flagged only as “buoy” — exposure weights unavailable in the digest; treat heights as basin-scale indicators rather than exact break-level predictions.
- Tides & obs: NOAA tide station 1612340 latest sea-level obs 2025-10-11 00:00 HST = 0.**45 ft**. Full local tide table for 10/13–10/15 not in digest (marking as n/a) — check NOAA station 1612340 before sessions for exact high/low times.

NORTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- Key breaks: Waimea, Ehukai (Pipeline/Banzai), Sunset Beach, Haleʻiwa.
- Oct 13: Oceanside will be dominated by fading NE/N residuals — expect smaller, inconsistent north sets. H1/3 from residuals trending down; treat matrix 6.**2 ft** H1/3 as decaying source rather than fresh energy. Confidence moderate; data shows window centered 10/10.
- Oct 14 (predawn → morning): The Aleutian **6 ft** H1/3 @13 s pulse is expected to arrive 03:40 HST and raise north-facing exposures. Expect longer-period, powerful sets — H1/10 set faces in the upper single digits to low double digits at the most exposed reefs/points if the pulse arrives as modeled (H1/10 ≈ **8 ft** as base; reef amplification can push faces larger). Conditions likely cleaner on the early ebb before trades/storm-related wind swings kick in. Confidence moderate — outcome sensitive to 1035 mb high position and buoy confirmations.
- Oct 15: Decay phase — sets drop back toward residual levels, still surfable at priority north points but less consistent. Tidal windows matter — heavier reef breaks prefer mid→low tide for steep, punchy faces; check NOAA tide station 1612340 for exact timing. Overall confidence 0.6; note static chart limitations and lack of live spectra in the packet.

SOUTH SHORE (Oʻahu)
- Key breaks: Waikiki, Ala Moana, Kewalos, south-point reef windows.
- General: South swell season is winding down — matrix shows modest ESE/S/SSE energy (ESE 5.**6 ft** @9 s; S 3.**0 ft** @12 s), but these are short-to-mid period and wind-affected. Expect chest-to-head-high sets at exposed south reefs on peak windows, with inconsistent ride quality on beach breaks.
- Oct **13–15 s**pecifics: small, wind-dependent south-swell pulses and trades will dominate. ESE component may give knee-to-chest-high occasional sets at Waikiki; H1/3 numbers from the matrix (5.**6 ft** ESE) are basin-sampled — expect smaller, variable local faces (H1/10 ~7.**3 ft** at exposed reefs is an upper basin indicator; actual south beach faces typically lower). Trades will produce short-period chop on windward shores and can make east/south exposures messy — watch local wind forecasts and buoy 51002 for nearshore confirmation.
- Confidence lower for exact set sizes because exposure amplification and local wind/time-of-tide interplay are not resolved in the digest.

OUTLOOK (beyond 10/15, 1–4 days)
- 10/16: Gulf Alaska pulse predicted (physics digest) — **5 ft** @10 s arrival 10/16 06:58 HST (distance 929 nm, travel-time ~2.5 days). Expect additional N/NW energy — shorter period than Aleutian pulse but could reinforce north exposures into 10/16–10/17. Monitor buoys 46089 / 51001 for confirmation.
- 10/17–10/18: Longer-range Aleutian remnant predicted (**4 ft** @11 s arriving 10/18) — expect gradual decay but elevated north-northwest background through the period. The 978–966 mb storm complex north of the islands (pressure analysis) could produce stronger follow-up NW energy in the 3–6 day window if the frontal fetch stays exposed and the 1035 mb high shifts east/weakens. If the high stays parked between source and islands, expect trade-dominated messy conditions instead.
- Tactical: if planning big north sessions mid-late next week, monitor buoy spectra (51001/51002/46089/46026) and model runs (WW3/GFS/ECMWF) 48–72 hrs out — the arrival/cleanliness hinge on high-pressure position and fetch continuity. Data gaps: static charts and absence of live buoy spectra in the packet reduce timing/height confidence — real-time buoy reads will be decisive.

Notes / Data caveats
- Digest confidence: medium (0.64/1.00). Most upstream charts were static snapshots; no live buoy time series or model animations included in packet — this increases arrival-peak timing uncertainty. Matrix sources flagged generically as "buoy"; exposure weighting was not available.
- Buoys to watch now: 51001, 51002, 46089, 46026 (use these for incoming period confirmation and Hs trends). Check local wind/METARs (PHNL) and NOAA tide station 1612340 before heading out.
- Forecast confidence: 0.6/1.0 — solid synoptic signals for NW energy exist, but the strong high north of Hawaii and lack of live spectra raise conditional uncertainty.

If you want, I’ll fetch live spectral reads from the four buoys, run per-break H1/3→H1/10 conversions for Waimea / Sunset / Pipeline / Waikiki and push a refined arrival timeline with tide windows for Oʻahu.

## North Shore Forecast

Dominant swell: through the 13th–15th the North Shore will be governed by lingering NE/N energy measured at buoy stations — 6.**2 ft** H1/3 (roughly 8.**1 ft** H1/10 estimate) from the NE/N with the measured windows centered on 2025‑10‑10. Add to that a modeled Aleutian pulse (**6 ft** @ 13 s) expected to arrive early Oct 14 (~03:40 HST) — that pulse is the wildcard that will lift sizes and add longer‑period, more powerful NW energy into the 14th and into the 15th peak period.

Wind / tide interplay (short and practical)
- Buoy and METAR reports show very light winds at the moment (PHNL VRB03 kt). Light morning winds will generally give clean lines on most reefs; typical fall pattern is for tradewind/sea‑breezes to reestablish in the afternoons, which will make the best surf windows the mornings and early forenoons.
- Tidal range is modest right now; reef breaks on the North Shore will respond strongly to small tide changes — lower tides tend to expose reefs and hollow the waves (better barrels at Pipeline and Sunset), while higher tides can make peaks pushy and fat. Check the local tide table before you paddle out; small timing differences will change whether a break barrels or just pushes.

Flagship break guidance (what to expect, H1/3 → H1/10 est, conditions and skill)
- Pipeline (Ehukai / Banzai): expect a jump from small/clean on the 13th to much heavier, more hollow sets on the 14th as the Aleutian pulse arrives. Forecast face: roughly **6–10 ft** H1/3 (≈ **8–12 ft** H1/10 est) at the pulse peak — fast, hollow and expert‑only. Morning offshore/very light winds will produce the cleanest barrels; afternoon seabreezes will make it pushy and blown out. Moderate confidence on exact peak timing.
- Sunset Beach: will react to both the NE residual and the incoming NW pulse — expect head‑high to overhead faces at peak on the 14th (similar H1/3 range to Pipeline but a touch more push and longer rides). Best on mid to incoming tides; expect bigger sets at dawn when winds are light. Strong currents and big hold‑downs are likely on sets — experienced surfers only.
- Waimea Bay: still marginal for a true big‑wave day with current measured energy, but the Aleutian pulse could produce notable increases in north‑facing groundswells late on the 14th. Expect shoulder‑to-head high faces with occasional bigger sets if the modeled **6 ft** @13 s holds and rides into the canyon — skill and caution required for any run‑outs. Confidence for Waimea turning into a proper big‑wave day is lower (30–50%).
- Haleiwa / Rocky Point: good all‑rounder to test size — expect waist‑to‑head high on the 13th, stepping up to head‑high+ on the 14th. Cleaner in the mornings; watch the jumbled period mix as NE and incoming NW energy interfere.

Hazards
- No broad government advisories flagged in the ingest, but expect hazardous conditions on the 14th if the Aleutian pulse verifies: strong shore rips, powerful currents, big shorebreaks and long hold‑downs at reef passes. Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea will produce serious impact zones — if you’re not experienced and mentally prepared for heavy wipeouts and long holds, sit it out. Always monitor local lifeguard and buoy cams.

Data confidence / uncertainties
- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence 0.64). Buoy coverage is good (12/13 successful), charts and other sources are available, but the North Shore quality index is modest (0.41) and several key swell components are from a few buoys with exposure weights around 0.50. The Aleutian pulse arrival (Oct 14 ~03:40 HST) has ~75% model confidence — it’s the main uncertainty for the 14th–15th forecast. In short: expect a clean, moderate surf window on the 13th, then a likely size/power increase with longer‑period NW energy on the 14th; exact peak heights and which breaks go heavy depend on how that Aleutian energy verifies. Keep checking buoy updates and local cams through the 13th night.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore forecast — Oct 13 → Oct 15, 2025
Confidence: Medium (0.64). Data notes: buoys, charts, METARs and satellite all reporting; 9 detected swell events fused into this brief. South‑Shore quality index currently low (0.40) — energy is present but mixed and not premium.

1) Quick, data‑backed opening assessment (size, direction, timing)
- Primary drivers through the period: residual ESE energy (buoy: 5.**6 ft** H1/3 @ 9 s) with a background southerly pulse (3.**0 ft** H1/3 @ 12 s) and smaller SSE energy (2.**3 ft** @ 11 s).
- Net expected South Shore levels (Hawaiian spot scale, H1/3): roughly 2.5–5.**0 ft** H1/3 across the three days, with estimated H1/10 peak sets in the 3.5–7.**5 ft** range on the better ESE sets. Expect the ESE component to dominate shorter‑period punch; the S/12s component will provide longer, cleaner lines when it hooks into shallow reefs.
- Timing: energy is already in the water and will persist through Oct 13–15. The larger Aleutian pulse modeled to arrive early Oct 14 (**6 ft** @ 13 s, 03:40 HST) is a north/NNW feature — it will mainly affect north/east exposures and has only limited wrap potential into true south‑facing reefs.

2) Wrap potential, background southern‑hemi pulses, and synoptic impact
- Wrap potential: modest. The dominant swell energy for these days is ESE→S; large NNW/Aleutian energy arriving early Oct 14 could produce some NE/ESE wrapping into east‑facing reefs (Diamond Head pocket especially) but expect only a modest directional adjustment — not a wholesale south‑shore size boost. In short: don’t bank on a late‑period “wrap” turning a small south swell into something much larger.
- Southern hemisphere/background pulses: the S 3.**0 ft** @ 12 s pulse (exposure weight high at 0.96) is the useful long‑period ingredient here — it smooths rides and extends faces for longboarders and retro single‑fin sessions. It won’t produce big open‑face power, but it raises consistency and gives longer takeoffs on reefy sections.
- Synoptic/wind impact: latest METAR (PHNL) shows very light, variable winds (~VRB03KT). That pattern is favorable for glassy mornings on the south shore. Model guidance and local climatology through fall suggest light, variable to weak E/NE breezes by midday — expect clean early sessions and the usual light seabreeze pickup in the afternoons. If trades strengthen unexpectedly, expect chop at exposed points.

3) Town vs. outlier breaks — spot‑specific readouts
Ala Moana / Waikiki (Canoes, Queens, Pops)
- Expected size: waist high → chest to head high (**2–4 ft** H1/3) through the window, with the better ESE sets pushing higher at the outer reef passes. H1/10 style peak sets will be noticeably more powerful at the outer peaks.
- Shape: long, forgiving walls from the S/12s and shorter, punchier lobes from the ESE/9s. Mornings will be cleaner with light winds.
- Crowd/consistency: very consistent and crowded. Best for longboarders and cruiser‑style shortboarders working long lines. Early mornings and just after mid‑tide will be the sweetest.
Diamond Head
- Expected size: chest → head‑plus on the better ESE sets; when the modeled Aleutian 13 s energy nudges in it could produce a few steeper, more powerful sets at Diamond Head’s east‑facing reef, but the wrap is limited.
- Shape: steeper takeoffs and faster walls — better for high‑performance shortboards. Longer period S/12s will smooth and elongate rides; ESE/9s produce punchier faces.
- Crowd/consistency: less crowded than Waikiki for experienced shortboarders willing to deal with steeper drops. Best mid‑tide to higher.

4) Longboard vs. shortboard suitability and crowd expectations
- Longboards: favored most days. The background S/12s deliver long, drawn‑out faces at Ala Moana and Waikiki Canoes. If you’re on a log, mornings will be easy and rewarding.
- Shortboards: Diamond Head (and the outer Waikiki peaks on the stronger ESE sets) will offer the steeper, hollowed ribbon rides shortboarders want — but the opportunity will be intermittent. Expect a lower percentage of quality steep waves than a true north‑hemisphere winter pulse would provide.
- Crowds: Waikiki remains the default destination for consistent, easy waves — expect heavy morning traffic. Diamond Head will thin out crowds but requires better positioning and quicker reflexes.

5) Tides and timing nuances
- Current tide gauge shows low recent levels and small range; classic fall timing means mid‑tide windows often give the best combination of peel and push on the reefs. For Waikiki/Ala Moana aim for mid to mid‑high tides for longest rides; Diamond Head tends to reward mid‑to‑lower tides for punchier sections when ESE is present. Check local tide table for exact windows on each day.

6) Final practical takeaways
- Oct 13: Small–moderate south/ESE mix. Best for longboards and cruisers in Waikiki/Ala Moana. Light, variable winds → clean mornings.
- Oct 14: Similar base state but watch the Aleutian arrival early in the day (modeled **6 ft** @ 13 s) — expect a modest bump/steepening for east‑facing reefs (Diamond Head) but not a large increase for true south exposures. Wind pattern still favors morning glass.
- Oct 15: Decaying ESE/S energy. Cleaner but smaller; longboarders still have the edge. Shortboarders can score limited, punchy sets at Diamond Head if the smaller ESE component holds.

7) Confidence & caveats
- Overall confidence medium (0.64). Buoy/obs coverage was good (12/13 buoys reporting; charts and METARs successful), but the South‑Shore quality index is only 0.40 — energy is present but mixed directionally and below premium thresholds. The Aleutian modeled arrival (Oct 14) carries moderate (~75%) confidence in timing/period; its impact on south‑facing beaches is limited by geometry and local sheltering.
- Bottom line: expect a surfable, mostly longboard‑friendly south shore run Oct 13–15 with intermittent punchier windows for shortboards at Diamond Head and the outer Waikiki passes. Light morning winds will be your ally — mornings will be the cleanest and most consistent windows.

If you want, I can:
- produce spot‑by‑spot expected face heights (H1/3 / H1/10) for Ala Moana, Canoes, Pops, and Diamond Head for each day,
- pull exact tide times for Oct 13–15 to highlight the best hour windows,
- or run a quick wind forecast check for the same period.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: Lingering N/NE energy keeps the North Shore rideable this morning (waist‑to‑head high at exposed points); light/variable winds — best to go early.

NORTH SHORE — faces & direction: North to NE-exposed breaks (Pipeline, Ehukai, Sunset/Velzyland) seeing the most energy; expected faces roughly waist → head high with occasional bigger sets; best window: early morning through mid‑morning (cleanest conditions before winds/sea breeze pick up).

SOUTH SHORE — faces & direction: South/SSE exposures largely small — knee to thigh at most spots, a few protected points rideable for longboards; best window: mid‑tide daylight hours if you want softer, more consistent walls.

EAST / WEST — quick hits:
- East (Kailua/Waimanalo): light E/ENE energy — small but glassy in the morning on light winds; good for SUP/longboard.
- West (Yokohama/North Shore west-facing coves): generally small and wind-sensitive — expect weak, choppy conditions later in the day.

WINDS: METAR shows very light, variable winds (~VRB 3 kt at PHNL) — translates to glassy conditions on most exposures early. Typical diurnal pattern may bring onshore trades or sea breeze by afternoon; plan morning sessions for the cleanest lines.

### Tides:
- Latest available obs (NOAA station 1612340): 0.**45 ft** (most recent reading in digest). Historical nearby extremes in digest: high ≈ +2.**38 ft**, low ≈ -0.**02 ft**. (Tide times for 10/13 not in this digest — check your local tide app/cams before you go.)

HAZARDS & NOTES: Watch for strong rips and occasional larger sets at exposed North Shore peaks; reef bottoms and shorebreak present at many spots — wear appropriate board/booties and pick spots within your ability. No tropical threats for Oahu in the 7‑day outlook.

PHYSICS-BASED SWELL WATCH: New Aleutian pulse expected to arrive early Tuesday (Oct 14 ~03:40 AM HST) — **6 ft** @ 13 s (moderate confidence). If that verifies, expect step-up on N/NNE exposures overnight into Tuesday.

ACTION ITEM: GO this morning if you want the cleanest North Shore session — aim for first light to mid‑morning; re-check live cams, local buoy and tide times before you drive. Confidence: medium (0.64).
