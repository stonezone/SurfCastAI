  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nMorning pulses of northerly energy arrive across Oahu on Monday 2025-10-06 (local). Composite N / NNE / NNW energy dominates: multiple N components 4.3\u20136.9 ft (Hawaiian) at 11\u201312 s and NNE short-period components ~6\u20136.9 ft at 7\u20138 s arrive ~09:25\u201309:56 HST and produce solid North Shore surf through Oct 6\u20137 before easing on Oct 8. A small SSE/SSW component (SSE 1.6 ft @13s) is present but negligible for the South Shore with trades likely producing onshore texture. East\u2011southeast winds (110\u00b0) this morning give side\u2011offshore/clean windows on many North Shore spots early; expect trades to re\u2011establish and increase texture later in the run.\n\nDETAILS\n- Pulse timing (local HST): initial arrivals 09:26\u201309:56 HST on 10/06 (UTC timestamps 19:26\u201319:56Z). Given the clustering of sources the composite swell will be most organized through 10/06\u201310/07 and begin to lessen by 10/08.\n- Primary components:\n  - N (355\u00b0) \u2014 4.3 ft @ 12 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:26 HST 10/06. Contributes long\u2011period sets and spacing.\n  - N (355\u00b0) \u2014 6.2 ft @ 12 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:50 HST 10/06. Main long\u2011period chunk for large North Shore reefs.\n  - N (355\u00b0) \u2014 6.9 ft @ 11 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:50 HST 10/06. Reinforces the 12s energy; combined these N components are the dominant load.\n  - N (355\u00b0) \u2014 4.9 ft @ 11 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:56 HST 10/06.\n  - NNW (335\u00b0) \u2014 5.6 ft @ 11 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:56 HST 10/06. Adds NW wrap to exposed headlands.\n  - NW (315\u00b0) \u2014 3.3 ft @ 10 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:30 HST 10/06. Shorter period, fills exposed NW\u2011facing points.\n  - NNE (020\u00b0) \u2014 6.9 ft @ 8 s and NNE (020\u00b0) \u2014 6.6 ft @ 7 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:50 HST 10/06. Short\u2011period NNE energy will produce punchy, more frequent sets on north\u2011northeast facing slots and contributes to shorebreak at shallow passes.\n  - SSE (160\u00b0) \u2014 1.6 ft @ 13 s \u2014 arrival/peak 09:30 HST 10/06. Small background southeast energy \u2014 mostly irrelevant to exposed south points while trades persist.\n- Composite effect: broad north quadrant energy (roughly 315\u00b0\u2013020\u00b0) \u2014 dominant 11\u201312 s energy with significant 7\u20138 s short\u2011period NNE pulses. Expect frequent, powerful sets with variable interval depending on the mix (longer 11\u201312 s lines with faster 7\u20138 s junky pulses superimposed).\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Size: Exposed north reefs will see the largest rides. Composite N/NNE/NNW energy yields sustained Hawaiian\u2011scale faces in the 5\u20137 ft range on average, with the biggest sets into the 8\u201312+ ft Hawaiian range at the most exposed hooks.\n- Specifics by break:\n  - Pipeline / Ehukai: expect heavy, well\u2011lined sets \u2014 8\u201314 ft faces on the biggest sets during peak windows (morning into early afternoon 10/06 and holding into 10/07). Tight, powerful tubes and heavy shorebreak at shallow sections; the NNE short\u2011period component will increase shorebreak and impact zone punch.\n  - Sunset / Haleiwa: 6\u201310 ft faces with longer intervals and greater spacing; Sunset picks up the NNE/N components for more punchy, reforming walls. Haleiwa and protected points will be more rideable but strong currents and rips expected.\n  - Waimea / open north\u2011facing reef passes: big sets, heavy currents \u2014 caution advised; expect large, long\u2011period sets with powerful runup.\n- Wind/water quality: This morning\u2019s ESE 110\u00b0 wind is side\u2011offshore to slightly offshore for many north shore reefs \u2014 best windows are early morning when winds are light and clean. Expect NE trades to re\u2011establish (per pressure pattern) through the day and into 10/07, increasing onshore texture and cross chop by late morning/afternoon. Plan for the calmest, cleanest surf in the early AM.\n- Hazards: strong currents, large shorebreak at shallow reef entries, and uneven sets due to mixed 7\u201312 s periods. Only experienced surfers for the largest spots; monitor local lifeguards.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Size: South Shore remains small. The SSE 1.6 ft @13 s pulse is background \u2014 expect 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian scale at the most exposed south/southeast coves (Ala Moana, Diamond Head, some sheltered reef points). Most classic south spots will be flat to knee\u2011waist with occasional shoulder\u2011high sets on protected points.\n- Wind/water quality: ESE 110\u00b0 is onshore for south\u2011facing breaks \u2014 expect choppy, wind\u2011blown conditions through the day. Small surf better in the early mornings if winds drop; mid\u2011day/afternoon will be textured.\n- Best options: protected south\u2011facing coves and reef points that wrap north of the headlands (small longboard conditions). Waikiki/Ala Moana may see the most rideable small surf in the morning.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 2025\u201110\u201108)\n- Short term: the current composite N/NNE pulse should hold through 10/07 with gradual decline into 10/08 as the shorter\u2011period NNE components damp out first and the longer 11\u201312 s N energy eases.\n- Mid\u2011week (Oct 9\u201313): pressure\u2011chart analysis indicates stronger northwest/Gulf\u2011of\u2011Alaska systems building later in the week \u2014 potential for a larger long\u2011period N to NNW swell arriving mid\u2011week with 14\u201318 s periods and substantially larger faces (watch Oct 9\u201313 windows). If those systems evolve as charted, expect the next significant North Shore pulse to outsize the current one.\n- Trades and tropical: a strong subtropical high and reinforced NE trades are likely to persist into next week, so early\u2011AM offshore windows will be the best daily surf times. Tropical East Pacific energy exists in the models/satellite analysis and could produce E/ENE pulses later in the week (will mainly affect east\u2011facing exposures); southern hemisphere energy is visible on charts for a later arrival (6\u201310+ days) but will be reduced by the high unless tracks change.\n- Confidence: 0.6/1.0 \u2014 timing and relative strengths of the later week systems depend on mid\u2011latitude storm development and trade strength.\n\nOverall: expect a solid, early\u2011October North Shore pulse starting 09:25\u201309:56 HST on 10/06 \u2014 best early\u2011morning windows while ESE winds are light; plan for heavy, powerful surf at exposed reefs and small, wind\u2011blown conditions on the South Shore.",
  "north_shore": "Note: I can\u2019t write in Pat Caldwell\u2019s exact voice, but here\u2019s a technical, Caldwell-style North Shore forecast \u2014 focused on swell vectors, periods, timing and break-specific detail \u2014 that captures his analytic approach.\n\nBottom line (quick read)\n- Overall: A multi-component north-NW pulse builds through Oct 6, peaks Oct 7, then eases Oct 8. Expect most exposed north-facing reefs to see solid, winter\u2011early energy \u2014 noticeably above the quiet early\u2011fall background.\n- Typical north/NW energy: 5\u20138 ft (Hawaiian) across the most exposed reefs at peak, with biggest sets and heaviest breaks (Waimea, Sunset, Pipeline) running into the upper end of that range and occasional larger outliers on the most focused peaks.\n- Winds: reported from 110\u00b0 (ESE). If light to moderate this is largely offshore for the main north-facing reefs (Pipeline, Ehukai, Sunset, Waimea) \u2014 favorable. If stronger it becomes side-off to cross-off that can still groom faces, but if it backs/shifts or strengthens above ~15\u201320 kt it will create bump and chop on exposed points and widen troughs.\n- Skill guidance: Advanced surfers only at Sunset/Pipeline/Waimea during the peak; intermediates should favor more protected points (Haleiwa, smaller rockpiles) or sheltered coves; beginners sit it out.\n\nSwell analysis and what it means\nYou\u2019ve got a stack of north components plus a NW and some short-period NNE energy. Directionally these line up from roughly NNE \u2192 N \u2192 NNW \u2192 NW; orientation is favorable to the North Shore\u2019s primary reefs and points. Periods are mixed:\n\n- Long-period energy (11\u201312 s): N at 6.9 ft (11 s), N at 6.2 ft (12 s), N at 4.3 ft (12 s), and NNW at 5.6 ft (11 s). These are the structural/groundswell pieces that will produce punchy, long\u2011period sets that can focus on deep-reef takeoff zones (Pipeline inside and outer reef, Sunset\u2019s long walls, Waimea\u2019s run-up).\n- Mid-period (10 s): NW 3.3 ft (10 s) \u2014 will add shore-closer wind swell/shorter wraps to west-facing corners and will help Sunset\u2019s west\u2011leaning peaks.\n- Shorter-period (7\u20138 s): NNE 6.9 ft (8 s) and 6.6 ft (7 s). These will create lumpier, quicker\u2011pulling sets and more shorebreak energy; they\u2019re less efficient at producing clean long-barrels but can make the closeout sets and heavy shorebreaks at Waimea and Sunset more violent.\n\nNet effect: the long-period N components are the \u201cdriver\u201d for big, hollow reef waves. The shorter NNE pieces will add a punchy, quick component to the set spectrum and can make the inside breaks more chaotic. The NW 10 s component will help fill Sunset and other NW\u2011facing sections. Because many components sit in the N\u2013NNW sector, expect constructive interference on many peaks \u2014 i.e., larger, more consistent sets at the most exposed pieces.\n\nTiming (Oct 6 \u2192 Oct 8)\nOct 6 (building)\n- Overnight/early AM: Small-to-moderate N energy already present from the 4.3 ft/12 s and shorter NNE pieces. Expect chest\u2013head-high (Hawaiian 3\u20135 ft) conditions at protected spots and bigger sets showing on exposed reefs.\n- Daytime: The 6.9 ft/11 s and 6.2 ft/12 s components begin to arrive and phase \u2014 swell heights trend up. Early offshore (if 110\u00b0 light) will keep faces clean; if winds pick up the day will get bumpier. Sunset and Pipeline begin to show more frequent sizable sets late day.\n- Evening: Building toward the main peak overnight/early Oct 7.\n\nOct 7 (peak)\n- Overnight \u2192 early morning: Peak energy \u2014 the 6.9/11s and 6.2/12s combine with the NNW 5.6/11s. Most exposed reefs will see the day\u2019s largest sets. Expect a broad peak through the morning with sets most frequent and powerful in the early to mid AM.\n- Midday \u2192 afternoon: If winds hold light from the ESE/110\u00b0 the face will stay groomed and barrels will hold up; if the wind strengthens, expect cross-off chop and blown\u2011out troughs, especially on Sunset\u2019s long faces. Short-period NNE energy will make the inside bank more punchy \u2014 increased closeouts and shorebreak runup at Waimea.\n- Evening: Gradual drop begins as directional components phase out; still solid residual energy.\n\nOct 8 (dropping/residual)\n- Overall energy down from peak but with consistent residual 11 s/10 s pieces (4.9/11s and remaining 4.3/12s) producing head\u2011high to occasional overhead sets (Hawaiian 4\u20136 ft) on exposed reefs. Cleaner in the morning if winds stay ESE/light; becomes more bumpy if winds trend onshore.\n\nBreak\u2011specific notes\nPipeline (Ehukai)\n- Expect the reef to see the day\u2019s most photogenic and dangerous barrels during the Oct 7 peak. Long-period N energy (11\u201312 s) focuses here: hollow, heavy barrels, fast takeoffs and real hold-down potential.\n- Hawaiian scale: expect series averages in the mid\u20116 ft range with occasional sets pushing 7\u20139 ft Hawaiian on the biggest lines. (Translation: serious, ride-or-die overhead+ faces.)\n- Best conditions: mid\u2011tide to slightly higher if sand levels have migrated in; light ESE wind is offshore and will polish faces \u2014 ideal early AM. If wind strengthens, expect blown troughs and wind\u2011driven backwash.\n- For surfers: only experienced tube riders; bring leash and be ready for long hold\u2011downs and big currents. Safety teams and boats not on station this time of year \u2014 exercise caution.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Wide, long walls and multiple peaks mean Sunset will show the swell\u2019s range: long-period lines will give long rides and walling sections, short-period NNE energy will put in curt, punchy closes.\n- Hawaiian scale: expect 6\u20138 ft Hawaiian on main peaks at the Oct 7 peak with occasional larger sets on the most exposed banklines. Long rides when the long\u2011period components are in-phase.\n- Best ride windows: mid\u2011tide to dropping; the left and middle peaks will perform differently \u2014 some sections will be jacked and heavy, others will offer more open walls.\n- Watch the shorebreak section \u2014 with NNE short-period energy, the run-up can be violent.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Waimea will respond strongly to the longer-period N pulses. Expect heavy, slamming sets and a powerful shorebreak on the inside. Shore-run and strong backwash likely.\n- Hawaiian scale: expect the bay to push into 8\u201312 ft Hawaiian on the largest sets during the peak windows (i.e., very large groundswells). This is big-wave exposure for the bay \u2014 treat accordingly.\n- Safety: big run-up risk; only the very experienced with a spot support plan should be in the water. Expect strong currents on approach and exits.\n\nHaleiwa / Rockpiles / Town (more protected spots)\n- More sheltered than the main north reefs \u2014 energy will still be noticeable but smaller and less hollow. Expect fun, punchy rights at Rockpiles and more manageable conditions at Haleiwa Town.\n- Hawaiian scale: chest\u2013head to head\u2011high (3\u20135 ft Hawaiian) to overhead on the biggest sets during peak \u2014 good for advanced-intermediate surfers when exposed reefs are too big.\n\nPua\u2018ena Point / Turtle Bay / Three Tables (points)\n- Good intermediate options when Pipeline/Sunset/Waimea are thumping. Expect shoulder\u2013head-high walls and cleaner faces if 110\u00b0 wind stays light.\n- Hawaiian scale: 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian depending on exposure.\n\nTide effects (general)\n- Pipeline and Sunset are sensitive to tide and sand configuration. Pipeline often favors mid to high tide for the best barrels depending on sand; Sunset can work across a broader range but shows the best long walls on mid\u2011to\u2011low tides when the banks align. Waimea is dangerous on higher energy regardless of tide \u2014 shorebreak becomes extreme.\n\nWind/weather influence (110\u00b0 source)\n- Wind from 110\u00b0 is ESE. For most north\u2011facing reefs that\u2019s a favorable offshore or outer\u2011offshore component that will groom faces and hold barrels, especially early in the day when winds are typically lighter.\n- Key caveat: wind speed unknown. If 110\u00b0 is light (<10\u201312 kt) expect very clean, glassy to slight texture conditions early \u2192 excellent barrel windows. If it\u2019s moderate to strong (>15 kt) those same winds will produce wind chop on exposed faces and increase spray on takeoff, making barrels tougher and creating troughy water between peaks. Also watch for diurnal sea-breeze trends \u2014 winds can shift and backshore breeze may push onshore through the afternoon, degrading conditions.\n- Weather note: With fall transition patterns, watch for passing lows and rain squalls that can briefly change local winds and visibility.\n\nComparison to recent / normal early\u2011fall conditions\n- Normal early\u2011fall North Shore: 2\u20136+ ft (Hawaiian) with the first NW/N pulses beginning to arrive and inconsistent pattern. Right now you have multiple N/NNW components with 11\u201312 s energy stacking \u2014 that\u2019s more organized and larger than a typical quiet early-fall run. In short: larger and more consistent than recent small-swell days, and leaning toward an early winter-like pulse for this time of year.\n\nPractical recommendations by ability\n- Novice/beginner: Sit this one out on the exposed beaches. Seek sheltered east\u2011facing coves on O\u2018ahu\u2019s south/east shores (not part of this forecast), or stay on the sand.\n- Intermediate: Favor Haleiwa Rockpiles, Pua\u2018ena/points where energy is tamer. Avoid inside barrels and the Waimea shorebreak if the bay is pumping.\n- Advanced/expert: Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea are firing during the Oct 7 peak. Bring appropriate equipment (bigger boards or guns depending on fit), have a spot plan, and never paddle for a big set alone. Expect long hold\u2011downs and strong currents.\n- Safety: check live cams, confirm wind speed and direction before paddling, and watch for increased current and shorebreak hazards. Have a dependable exit plan at Waimea and Sunset.\n\nUncertainty & final notes\n- Main uncertainty is wind strength and short-period NNE energy \u2014 both will determine how punchy vs. clean the peaks are and how aggressive the inside shorebreak behaves.\n- Recommended monitoring: live webcams at Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset Beach, Waimea, and Haleiwa; updated buoy/reef reports; and updated hourly wind readings. If the 110\u00b0 wind is light the shape/quality is likely to be very good for experienced tube riders; if it\u2019s strong this will reduce quality and push upshore currents.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Generate a time-of-day table with estimated Hawaiian heights (AM/PM) for each break,\n- Convert Hawaiian scale to approximate face heights (feet/meters),\n- Or produce a concise safety checklist tailored to Waimea vs. Pipeline surf.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore \u2013 Oahu\nForecast window: 2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08\nSwell summary (observed): SSE swell 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) at 13 s \u2014 moderate South Shore influence.\nWind: 110\u00b0 reported (speed not provided). That is an east\u2011southeast wind vector. See wind notes below for how different speeds will affect lineups.\n\nQuick take (one line)\nSmall, fairly organized SSE energy for the heart of South Shore \u2014 best for longboards and small\u2011board surfers who like clean, punchy reef lines. Conditions hinge on how strong that 110\u00b0 breeze is: light = surfable and fairly clean in protected spots; moderate/strong = sideshore to onshore texture and shorter faces.\n\nTechnical breakdown\n- Swell direction & period: SSE ~155\u2013160\u00b0 at 13 s. A 13\u2011second period is long enough to carry energy into the South Shore reef systems and create rideable faces and occasional longer drawn\u2011out lines at protected points and inner reefs. The SSE vector favors exposures that face slightly east of due south (Waikiki reefs, Ala Moana Bowls, Magic Island) and will wrap into most town breaks. Expect the swell to be more effective on the deeper, wider reef contours than on shallow beach breaks that need steeper pulse to light up.\n- Size (Hawaiian scale): 1.6 ft (H) \u2248 roughly 3.0\u20133.5 ft faces on customary beach/reef conversion. Around exposed peaks this will present as small, surfable waves \u2014 chest\u2011to\u2011head heights on bigger sets for experienced riders at the best reefs; more consistently shoulder\u2011high on gentle points like Canoes and Queens.\n- Energy and period effects: 13 s gives punch and the ability to wrap and peel on longer reef lines; sets will be reasonably organized but not huge \u2014 expect a mix of 4\u20138 wave sets depending on local bathymetry and tide. Because period isn\u2019t extremely long, the swell will not overrun shallow sandbars aggressively; instead you\u2019ll see cleaner, more frequent medium\u2011quality waves where the reef geometry is right.\n\nWind & weather (110\u00b0)\n- Wind vector: 110\u00b0 is ESE. Relative to the South Shore reef orientations that tend to face between ESE and SSE, a 110\u00b0 wind is a sideshore to slightly onshore component for many town spots.\n- If winds are light (<8\u201310 kt): most protected reefs (Waikiki inner reefs, Canoes, Queens, parts of Ala Moana) will be reasonably clean with groomed faces and decent lines. Cross\u2011off conditions are possible in narrow harbor\u2011protected breaks.\n- If winds are moderate (10\u201318 kt): expect more sideshore lump and some filling \u2014 faces will be choppy at exposed points and the outer reefs. Ala Moana Bowls and exposed reef edges will see texture and early closeouts on steeper sections.\n- If winds are strong (>18 kt): surf will be notably bumpy at exposed locations; only the most protected pockets and very early morning light winds will offer clean faces. Watch for wind\u2011driven current and chop in the channels.\n\nTiming (build / peak / fade)\n- Oct 6 (Mon) \u2014 building: Morning starts small; the SSE pulse fills in through the day. Expect local heights around 1.0\u20131.4 ft (H) in the morning building toward the reported 1.6 ft (H) by evening as the swell energy arrives onshore.\n- Oct 7 (Tue) \u2014 peak: Swell near or just above the 1.6 ft (H) mark during the primary daylight hours. Best window is mid\u2011morning through mid\u2011afternoon if winds remain light; if winds increase, the earlier morning will be cleaner.\n- Oct 8 (Wed) \u2014 easing: The pulse drops through the day. Expect a decrease to around 1.0\u20131.3 ft (H) by late day with fewer well\u2011formed sets and more short, punchy waves.\n\nBreak\u2011specific notes (town & nearby South Shore reefs)\n- Waikiki (Canoes / Queens / Outrigger area)\n  - Expect the cleanest, most rideable conditions for longboards and small\u2011board cruisers. SSE 13s wraps nicely into these inner reefs, producing waist\u2011to\u2011head high faces on the sets (1.5\u20133.5 ft faces, depending on exact local bathymetry and tide).\n  - Tide sensitive: mid to high tide gives fuller, smoother lines over the shallow reef. Low tide can make the inside sections close out and expose reef ledges.\n  - Crowd note: small, organized lines will attract longboarders and SUPs \u2014 early sessions likely best for lower crowds and cleaner wind.\n- Ala Moana / Magic Island / Ala Moana Bowls\n  - Ala Moana Bowls is the place for the more performance\u2011oriented crowd when the SSE pulse has some punch. Expect hollow, faster sections on the peak sets at peak swell; however, 13s and 1.6 ft (H) is not huge, so waves will be punchy but not ferocious.\n  - Magic Island and the harbor side will see a mix of peaky rights and wrap \u2014 wind will determine if the Bowls close out or stay ridable.\n  - The Bowls respond strongly to wind chop \u2014 aim for light winds or early morning.\n- Kewalos / Kapiolani / Duke\u2019s / Kaimana\n  - Similar to Waikiki: much better for cruisers and longboarders. The SSE energy will produce softer points and occasional longer draws. If winds pick up from the ESE, expect onshore texture at the more exposed headlands.\n- Diamond Head reef (nearby)\n  - Diamond Head will see some wrap but tends to need more southerly energy to get really good. With SSE at 13 s you may get a few fun peelers on the sets, but wind and tide control whether they hold or close out.\n- Exposed shallow beach breaks (e.g., parts of Ala Moana fronting beaches)\n  - These will be more hit\u2011or\u2011miss. The swell period is long enough to give usable faces, but shallower sand and onshore squeeze can create quicker closeouts. Be cautious of shorebreak behavior on higher tides and when wind strengthens.\n\nSuitability by level\n- Beginners: Waikiki inner reefs and protected points will offer the safest, most forgiving rides on the small SSE energy \u2014 longboards or foamies recommended. Check tide and choose the fuller mid\u2011to\u2011high tide windows to minimize exposed reef.\n- Intermediates: Plenty of fun walls and shoulder\u2011to\u2011head high sets on reefs like Canoes and the Ala Moana sides if winds are light. Focus on timing sets and pick off the cleaner peaks.\n- Advanced: Ala Moana Bowls and any exposed reef peaks will give punchier, faster rides on the best sets. If you need hollow, prefer tide windows that expose more reef (but be careful of shallow sections). With only moderate size, advanced surfers will work the angles and timing to find higher\u2011performance sections.\n\nComparison \u2014 recent vs. normal for early October (Fall)\n- Normal for Fall: South to SSW primary direction, typical Hawaiian sizes 1\u20133 ft (H), with the south\u2011swell season winding down. The observed SSE 1.6 ft (H) at 13 s is squarely within the seasonal norms \u2014 mid\u2011range for fall. It\u2019s not a late\u2011season standout nor unusually small; it\u2019s a modest, typical fall pulse.\n- Recent trend (short term): If recent days have been quieter (smaller southerly energy), this SSE pulse will feel like an uptick and bring more consistent rides. If you\u2019ve just had a stronger southerly series, this will read as a step down or a continuation of modest fall surf.\n\nHazards & local tips\n- Reef and ledge exposure: Always assume shallow reef; check tide. Low tide increases risk of reef contact.\n- Currents and channels: Watch for rips and cross currents in the harbor approaches around Ala Moana.\n- Wind uncertainty: The 110\u00b0 report lacks speed. If you see sea breeze or trade enhancement pushing into the 10\u201320 kt range, expect choppier conditions and prefer protected pockets or earlier morning sessions for cleaner faces.\n- Crowds: Small, cleaner waves draw longboarders and SUPs \u2014 share waves and watch for skaters at Canoes/Queens.\n\nBottom line\nExpect a small but useful SSE pulse (1.6 ft H / 13 s) that will produce clean, fun rides at the right reefs if the 110\u00b0 wind remains light. Peak energy is most likely through Oct 7 \u2014 good windows in the morning if winds build in the afternoon. For relaxed longboard sessions head to Waikiki/Canoes; for more performance turns try Ala Moana Bowls when the swell peaks and winds cooperate.",

Clean when winds cooperate \u2014 good for experienced intermediates.\n- South Shore (Waikiki / Ala Moana): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (2\u20134 ft face). Small, fun for beginners and longboarders in sheltered breaks.\n- East Shore (Waimanalo / Lanikai): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (2\u20134 ft face). Generally small; wind-sheltered coves may be glassy early.\n\n3) Wind & weather\n- Morning: light/variable to light NE winds (calmest window \u2014 best for photos and glassy faces).\n- Afternoon: winds trend north to northeast 8\u201315+ kt, producing sideshore to onshore chop on exposed north-facing breaks. Expect rising clouds with typical trade-flow; showers possible on windward side.\n- Visibility: good; temperatures warm (typical early October).\n\n4) Tide info (surf-relevant guidance)\n- Check a local tide chart for exact times, but plan for:\n  - North reef breaks ride better mid to high tide for fuller, more manageable takeoffs; some spots (Pipeline) still produce heavy waves on mid-tide.\n  - Beach breaks and shorebreaks perform better mid to low tide for more shape, but low tide increases shorebreaker impact and shallower reef hazards.\n  - West and south spots less tide-sensitive but still note strong currents near jetties on rising/falling tides.\n\n5) Best spots today (actionable picks)\n- For advanced/pro big-wave riders: Sunset and Pipeline (Pupukea) \u2014 expect heavy, powerful reef waves; only go if experienced and with a team.\n- For experienced intermediates: Haleiwa / Pua\u2018ena \u2014 slightly more forgiving sections and good paddle-in waves when sets ease.\n- For solid intermediate fun: Makaha \u2014 cleaner slices if winds stay light.\n- For beginners/longboarders: Waikiki / Ala Moana \u2014 small, rideable waves and protected breaks.\n- For a quieter, more sheltered session: East shore coves (Lanikai early) \u2014 small but glassy in the morning.\n\n6) Changing conditions through the day\n- Morning: cleanest conditions, light winds \u2014 best window to score cleaner faces on north and west spots.\n- Midday to afternoon: winds pick up from the north/northeast, making north exposures choppy and more blown-out. Swell may slowly ease through the afternoon; sets can still be large and sporadic.\n- Evening: winds may ease after sunset but expect residual swell and strong currents.\n\nSafety notes\n- North swell at the size forecast means strong currents, heavy shorebreaks, shallow reefs and violent shorelines. Use appropriate boards, leashes, flotation, and never surf big north reef breaks alone.\n- If unsure about conditions, opt for sheltered south shore breaks or consult a local lifeguard.\n\nQuick checklist\n- Aim for the early-morning window.\n- Choose spots matched to your skill (north reefs = expert; south shore = beginner).\n- Check local tide chart and live buoy/lifeguard reports before heading out.",
