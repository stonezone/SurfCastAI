Please paste the forecast you\u2019d like me to review and rewrite, and I\u2019ll deliver an optimized version.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll deliver after you paste it:\n- A technically accurate, clearer version with consistent swell heights, periods, and directions\n- Full coverage for all relevant shores and time windows (morning, midday, late)\n- Internal consistency (same units, time zone, direction conventions, rounding)\n- Specific timing, locations, and condition notes (best breaks, wind windows, tides)\n- Preservation of your original voice and style, with improved clarity and detail\n\nIf it helps, you can share any of the following to tailor the output:\n- Target area(s) and breaks to emphasize (e.g., north/northwest shores, exposed reef, point breaks)\n- Known local caveats (shoreline shifts, wind fetch quirks, seasonal patterns)\n- Forecast timeframe (e.g., 24\u201348 hours, 5 days) and update cadence\n- Model/run used (e.g., NOAA, GFS/ECMWF blend) and preferred units (ft/m, knots, etc.)\n\nWhat I\u2019ll watch for and fix in every forecast:\n- Technical accuracy: consistent swell height (ft/m), period (s), and direction (bearing or labeled cardinal direction)\n- Clarity: translate model outputs into actionable guidance (e.g., \u201cbest early morning onshore winds fade by late morning\u201d)\n- Completeness: cover all major shores, wind/sea states, tides, and advisory notes\n- Consistency: uniform units, abbreviations, and tone throughout\n- Specificity: precise times, locations, and condition flags (e.g., knee-to-chest at X break, NW wind 10\u201315 mph)\n\nPaste the forecast now and I\u2019ll produce an optimized version right away.",
