  "main_forecast": "OAHU SURF FORECAST ISSUED 08 JUNE 2025 0800 HST\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA moderate 3-5 foot (Hawaiian) northwest swell will peak today with good conditions during the morning hours. Trade wind swell is adding 2-3 foot chop to north and east-facing shores. South shores are seeing a small 1-2 foot south swell. Light to moderate ENE trades will prevail through the forecast period.\n\nDETAILED FORECAST\n\nThe current northwest (315°) swell is from a gale that developed near the Kuril Islands four days ago. This swell began filling in yesterday, will peak today, and gradually decrease through Monday. The peak period of 13 seconds indicates good quality open-ocean energy, with the most favorable conditions during the morning hours before the trade winds increase.\n\nA small but consistent south (190°) swell is providing some activity on south-facing shores. This is primarily a background southern hemisphere swell with periods of 8 seconds. It will maintain through the weekend at similar levels.\n\nTrade wind swell from ENE (70°) is affecting primarily east-facing shores with some wrap to north shores. This shorter period (7 seconds) energy is a result of the persistent trade wind flow and adds chop to the main swells.\n\nWinds will be ENE at 15-20 knots with occasional higher gusts, with the lightest winds during the early morning hours. Partly cloudy conditions with scattered showers will persist, mainly affecting windward and mauka areas.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n\nNorthwest swell will provide the best action on the North Shore today. Expect sets of 3-5 feet (Hawaiian) at exposed breaks like Sunset Beach, with slightly smaller surf at other spots. Wave faces of 6-10 feet will be common at the better breaks. Early morning will offer the cleanest conditions before trade winds increase. Standout breaks like Pipeline will be working, though not at winter capacity. The steep swell angle (315°) means that exposed west-facing sections of the North Shore will see the largest waves.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n\nSouth shores are seeing smaller but rideable conditions with the current south swell. Expect heights of 1-2 feet (Hawaiian) or 2-4 foot faces at the best exposures. Town spots like Ala Moana Bowls and Kaisers can provide some fun rides during the higher tide periods. Some very inconsistent sets from the wrapping northwest swell may occasionally reach well-exposed west-facing sections of the South Shore. Most consistent waves will be at breaks directly exposed to the south, with longer waits between sets.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe northwest swell will gradually diminish through Monday and Tuesday. No significant new north swells are expected in the extended forecast. The small south swell will maintain through the weekend with a slight increase possible by Tuesday from a new southern hemisphere system. Trade winds and associated windward chop will continue through the week at similar levels.",
  "north_shore": "NORTH SHORE CONDITIONS\n\nThe North Shore is currently experiencing a moderate northwest swell (315°) with Hawaiian scale heights of 3-5 feet (6-10 foot faces). This swell is characterized by a solid 13-second period, providing good power and form at the better exposed breaks.\n\nMorning conditions are favorable with lighter trade winds, making this the optimal time for surfing today. As the day progresses, ENE trades will increase to 15-20 knots, adding chop and side-texture to waves, particularly at spots with less protection.\n\nThe primary energy is from a northwest direction, favoring spots like Sunset Beach and Off-The-Wall. Pipeline is working on the larger sets, though not barreling with winter intensity. West-facing sections of Haleiwa may see occasional larger sets due to the steep northwest direction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a short-period (7-second) trade wind swell adding some chop, particularly at spots with eastern exposure. This is providing 1-2 foot background energy at spots like Chun's Reef.\n\nBREAK-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS\n\nSunset Beach: Most consistent spot today with 3-5 foot sets (Hawaiian). Best during the morning hours before winds increase. Outside peak is connecting through to inside bowl on the larger sets.\n\nPipeline: Working but not exceptional. 2-4 foot waves (Hawaiian) with occasional larger sets. Some hollow sections during the dropping tide.\n\nHaleiwa: West-facing sections catching solid 3-4 foot waves with good shape during the morning glass-off. Becomes choppy by mid-day.\n\nWaimea Bay: Too small for Waimea to break properly. Not recommended today.\n\nChun's Reef: Fun longboard conditions with 2-3 foot waves and longer shoulders during the morning hours.\n\nCompared to typical early summer conditions, this northwest swell is slightly above average for June. This time of year typically sees declining north swell activity as we transition deeper into summer patterns.",
  "south_shore": "SOUTH SHORE CONDITIONS\n\nThe South Shore is experiencing a small but consistent south swell (190°) producing 1-2 foot waves (Hawaiian scale) with 2-4 foot faces at the best exposed breaks. This swell has an 8-second period, typical of background southern hemisphere energy during this time of year.\n\nWind conditions are generally favorable for South Shore breaks in the morning hours, with offshore to side-offshore flow at most spots. By mid-day, the ENE trades at 15-20 knots will create some texture on the surface, though many town spots remain relatively protected.\n\nA very minimal amount of northwest wrap is reaching some west-facing sections of the South Shore, occasionally mixing with the primary south swell at spots like Tracks or Ala Moana Bowls during the higher tide periods.\n\nFor early June, these conditions are fairly typical, though slightly below average. We're entering the prime south swell season, and larger pulses are expected in the coming weeks and months.\n\nBREAK-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS\n\nAla Moana Bowls: Working on the sets with 1-2 foot (Hawaiian) waves. Best around mid-tide when there's enough water on the reef but still good shape. Expect long waits between better sets.\n\nKaisers: Catching the south swell at 1-2 feet with occasional longer rides connecting through the inside section. Most consistent during the mid to high tide.\n\nWaikiki: Good conditions for beginners and longboarders with 1-2 foot waves. Outside breaks like Populars and Canoes are catching small but rideable waves throughout the day.\n\nDiamond Head: Inconsistent but picking up some of the swell at 1 foot (Hawaiian). Very long waits between sets.\n\nKewalos: Catching some of the south swell with 1-2 foot sets. The steeper faces here make it more rideable despite the small size.\n\nExpect crowds at the more popular spots since conditions are generally fun for longboarding and beginner/intermediate surfing. Early morning sessions will offer the cleanest conditions before the trade winds increase.",
  "daily": "DAILY SURF REPORT FOR JUNE 8, 2025\n\nNorth Shore: Northwest swell providing 3-5 foot Hawaiian (6-10' faces) waves at exposed breaks. Best early morning before trade winds increase. Standout breaks include Sunset Beach, Pipeline, and Haleiwa. Decent shape with 13-second periods.\n\nSouth Shore: Small but consistent south swell with 1-2 foot Hawaiian (2-4' faces) conditions. Best spots include Ala Moana Bowls, Kaisers, and Waikiki. Good for longboarding and beginners. Most consistent during mid-tide periods.\n\nEast Shores: Trade wind swell producing choppy 2-3 foot conditions. Primarily affected by ENE winds at 15-20 knots.\n\nWest Shores: Picking up some wrap from the northwest swell, 1-3 foot waves at exposed spots. Generally inconsistent but occasional good sets.\n\nWind/Weather: ENE trades 15-20 knots, strongest during afternoon. Partly cloudy with scattered showers, mainly affecting windward areas. Temperature around 80°F (27°C).\n\nTides: High tide at 10:45am (2.1ft) and 11:15pm (1.8ft).
