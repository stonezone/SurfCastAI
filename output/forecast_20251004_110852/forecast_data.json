  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nEarly-fall northwest energy builds across the islands Oct 4\u20135, producing small-to-moderate north-facing surf. Expect a background, fading south-swell component with small long-period energy. Wind observations are unavailable \u2014 forecast confidence below normal.\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary NW swell: Direction ~300\u00b0\u2013320\u00b0 (true), period 11\u201315 s. Energy arrives late Oct 4, builds through Oct 5, peaks in the morning\u2013early afternoon Oct 5, then trends down Oct 6. Hawaiian-scale size: generally 4\u20137 ft on exposed northwestern and north shore reef passes; cleaner sheltered spots will be smaller.\n- Secondary S/SE background: Direction ~170\u00b0\u2013190\u00b0, period 8\u201310 s. Small residual energy through Oct 4\u20135 with Hawaiian-scale 1\u20132 ft; largely inconsequential for exposed north shores but will show up on south-facing beaches.\n- Wind/weather note: No wind observations provided. Best-case scenario is light/variable winds early mornings \u2014 expect cleaner conditions then. If trades establish in the afternoons, expect northeasterly onshores for many north-facing exposures, degrading shape.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Oct 4: Swell building late. Morning will be small-clean at protected spots; exposed outer reefs see 3\u20134 ft Hawaiian. Best windows early morning if winds are light.\n- Oct 5 (peak): Primary NW energy peaks with exposed reef passes and points seeing 5\u20137 ft Hawaiian scale. Ehukai and Pipeline-lineup: bigger, more powerful than average for early October \u2014 expect hollow sections at the most exposed reefs; Sunset and Haleiwa see solid, rideable sets but shape will depend heavily on local wind. Waimea: increased size and strong current risk at the peak \u2014 sets possible but inconsistent. Early morning is the cleanest window if winds stay light; afternoon trade/onshore flow will deteriorate form.\n- Oct 6: Decline day \u2014 swell drops to 3\u20135 ft Hawaiian on exposed breaks, with clean pockets at sheltered spots in the morning. Currents remain a factor at exposed passes.\n\nSpecifics by break (approximate, Hawaiian-scale)\n- Pipeline / Ehukai: 6\u20138 ft Hawaiian at peak (Oct 5 AM), powerful, fast, and hollow on the biggest sets.\n- Sunset Beach: 5\u20137 ft Hawaiian with long intervals and punchy sets at peak.\n- Haleiwa: 4\u20136 ft Hawaiian, good walling sets in protected coves.\n- Waimea Bay: Elevated pulse at peak \u2014 strong currents, occasional big faces; use caution.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Oct 4\u20135: Small residual south energy 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian; most south-facing spots remain small and bank-dependent. Ala Moana and Waikiki will see small knee-to-waist high waves with the best shape on low-tide banks and protected mornings.\n- Oct 6: Expect further fade \u2014 largely knee-high or smaller at the typical summer/spring south exposures. Diamond Head and east-facing reef points may produce small surf for longboarders when winds are light.\n\nOUTLOOK\n- Through Oct 6: NW swell eases after the Oct 5 peak; small residual north-northwest energy will linger through Oct 6 with improving odds for cleaner early-morning windows if winds are light.\n- Beyond Oct 6: Fall pattern favors increasing northwest-grade storm activity \u2014 models show potential for renewed NW fetch later in the week, but confidence is low given limited wind/model input. Monitor for a stronger NW pulse later in the week that could push more consistent medium-period energy into the North Shore.\n\nOverall Forecast Confidence: 0.4/1.0 \u2014 limited wind and detailed swell data. Treat timing and size ranges as provisional; early-morning conditions typically offer the best surf quality during this transition season.",
  "north_shore": "North Shore \u2014 technical fall forecast (Pat Caldwell style)\nValid: 2025-10-04 00:00 HST through 2025-10-06 23:59 HST\nConfidence: Moderate (model agreement on a NW pulse; local wind/tide observations will change rideability)\n\nSummary\n- Primary energy: NW\u2013WNW ground/short-period pulse arriving early Oct 4, building into Oct 5, then easing Oct 6.\n- Period: predominately 13\u201316 s (some energy at 11\u201312 s mixed into the leading edge).\n- Hawaiian scale heights: small-to-moderate on Oct 4, solid mid-to-large on Oct 5 (near the top end of early-fall range), easing Oct 6.\n- Direction and period favor the open north-facing reefs (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) \u2014 expect strong, steep surf with fast faces where the reef lines up with 300\u2013315\u00b0 energy.\n- Wind uncertainty: no local obs provided. Typical early-fall pattern would be light variable to NE trades by mid/late morning and strengthening in the afternoon. A light to moderate E\u2013NE trade will be cross/side-on at many north-facing breaks; stronger onshore (E\u2013SE) would dent form. Check local buoy/obs for final decision.\n\nQuick note on Hawaiian scale terminology used here\n- 1\u20133' Hawaiian \u2014 knee to waist-high\n- 3\u20135' Hawaiian \u2014 waist to chest/shoulder-high\n- 5\u20137' Hawaiian \u2014 head-high to overhead\n- 7\u201310'+ Hawaiian \u2014 solid overhead to big/dangerous (double-overhead+)\nI use Hawaiian as the primary metric and add short descriptive notes (rideability, type of breaks that will respond).\n\nSwell analysis (why)\n- A short-to-moderate period NW pulse is indicated by models through the period window. Energy arrives from a WNW/NW quadrant (roughly 300\u2013315\u00b0) with 13\u201316 s dominant periods \u2014 long enough to wrap into Pipeline and Sunset efficiently and to generate punch at Waimea and the Banzai reef complex.\n- The leading edge will include slightly shorter-period energy (~11\u201312 s), which will make peaks steep and punchy on shallow reefs; the longer-period core (14\u201316 s) will be the driver for hollow, fast barrels and larger faces on the main points/reefs.\n- For fall on the North Shore this orientation is the seasonal norm (NW\u2013WNW), so breaks will respond in a classic north-shore manner.\n\nTiming (building / peaking / dropping)\n- Oct 4 (Sat): pulse arrives. AM: modest read of the new NW energy \u2014 building through the day. Hawaiian: 3\u20135' at exposed reefs by afternoon. Rideability: good windows for intermediate-to-advanced surfers at protected and mid-sized spots; large reefs still clean but not yet at their maximum.\n- Oct 5 (Sun): swell near peak. Most exposed reefs see the largest faces and most hollow conditions. Hawaiian: 6\u20138' on the most exposed sections at peak sets; many breaks will report consistent 5\u20137' Hawaiian with bigger sets to 8'. Best windows early-mid morning for cleaner conditions if trades remain light; expect the swell to hold through most of the day and begin to slowly drop in energy after sunset/local late evening.\n- Oct 6 (Mon): energy decays but longer-period tail maintains shape on the best reefs. Hawaiian: 4\u20136' at exposed reefs early, easing to 3\u20135' by late day. Cleaner early if winds remain light; afternoon trades will make conditions choppier/side-on.\n\nWind and weather effects (North Shore specifics)\n- With no live wind obs, assume a typical fall diurnal: light and variable early (pre-dawn to mid-morning), with NE trade tendency building into the afternoon (10\u201318 kt range typical). NE trades are side/side-off at many north-facing reefs, but at some spots (more east-facing bays) they can be cross-on.\n- Cleanest windows are usually early morning when trades are light. If an early-morning Kona or southerly fetch shows up, it can temporarily clean or muddle certain spots \u2014 check local cams.\n- Rain/storms from localized low-pressure cells are possible in fall transition; these can increase onshore winds and runoff, hitting quality reef breaks (Hale\u2019iwa, Chun\u2019s, etc.) with dirty water. Waimea\u2019s run-in from the valley can be influenced by any heavy rain upstream.\n\nBreak-by-break details (practical and technical)\nNote: Hawaiian heights below are the anticipated range for each day; pick your location and ability level carefully.\n\nPipeline (Ehukai / Banzai)\n- Swell exposure: prime to core energy (reef direct to NW\u2013WNW).\n- Oct 4: 3\u20135' Hawaiian \u2014 clean pockets, some head-high barrels on set waves mid-day into afternoon if winds stay light.\n- Oct 5 (peak): 6\u20138' Hawaiian with bigger sets \u2014 expect hollow, fast, heavy barrels; hold the lip, shallow sections will punch. Only experienced, local-knowledge surfers and bodyboarders should be in the water on peak sets. Shoals and currents will be strong. Tidal sensitivity: medium to high; mid to mid-high tends to give deeper pits but check exact tide for hours.\n- Oct 6: 4\u20136' Hawaiian easing \u2014 still solid barrels on sets, but less frequency and slightly cleaner if trades remain light early.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Swell exposure: excellent to full; Favored by the slightly more WNW component.\n- Oct 4: 3\u20135' Hawaiian \u2014 long, fast faces develop on larger sets; good surf for intermediate-to-advanced lineups.\n- Oct 5: 6\u20139' Hawaiian at the peak sets \u2014 very powerful, long walls, big pits where the reef/channel lines up. Expect heavy sections and long rides on the inside. Hold for larger sets and be aware of heavy shorebreak on the inside.\n- Oct 6: 4\u20136' Hawaiian \u2014 still strong but much more manageable for experienced surfers; peaks will be less frequent.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Swell exposure: very receptive to long-period NW energy; heavy shorebreak ramp-up potential.\n- Oct 4: 3\u20135' Hawaiian \u2014 occasional big sets pushing into the bay; increased current and shorebreak awareness required.\n- Oct 5: 7\u201310' Hawaiian on largest sets \u2014 big charging conditions; watermen conditions only. Expect strong currents, a heavy inside shorebreak, and large paddle-outs. The bigger end of the forecast could produce true Waimea charging conditions on sets \u2014 this is a big-swell day if models verify.\n- Oct 6: 5\u20137' Hawaiian early, easing to 3\u20135' \u2014 still substantial, but cleaner and safer windows later in the day.\n\nHaleiwa / Chun's / Off-the-wall (Haleiwa Alley & adjacent points)\n- Swell exposure: these west-of-Ehukai points often see slightly reduced but very surfable energy; direction-dependent.\n- Oct 4: 2\u20134' Hawaiian \u2014 fun, chest-shoulder high in protected pockets (Haleiwa) with long-period sets on the points.\n- Oct 5: 4\u20136' Hawaiian (Haleiwa) with sets larger at the points \u2014 fast open faces and some hollow sections at Chun's/Off-the-wall. Haleiwa Harbor will get pushy and current-prone on the biggest sets.\n- Oct 6: 3\u20135' Hawaiian easing \u2014 good for experienced longboarders and shortboarders depending on local wind.\n\nOther notable spots (Velzyland, Rocky Point, Tongg\u2019s, Kawela)\n- Velzyland / Rocky Point: will get punchy WNW energy; expect 4\u20137' Hawaiian on peak on Oct 5, good barrels and big sections.\n- Tongg\u2019s / Kawela: more exposed to WNW; if the swell trends slightly westward those spots can see heavier sets and more shoulder-to-overhead waves on Oct 5.\n\nTide and short-term considerations\n- Reef breaks on the North Shore are tide sensitive. Mid to mid-high tide generally produces fuller faces on many north reefs; very low tide can close out or make sections dangerously shallow.\n- Currents: expect stronger rips and lateral currents during the build/peak; channel currents at Sunset and Waimea will intensify with larger swell.\n- If winds verify as light early mornings, the AM sessions (particularly Oct 5) will be the cleanest windows.\n\nSuitability / safety\n- Oct 4: Intermediate to advanced surfers can find good waves at many spots; pick protected options if uncomfortable with size.\n- Oct 5: Advanced to expert only at the exposed reefs (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea). If you\u2019re not confident in big, hollow north-shore reef breaks, pick smaller, more protected breaks or stay off the water.\n- Oct 6: Conditions return to a more rideable level \u2014 advanced surfers can still score good waves; intermediates should pick spots carefully.\n\nHow this compares to recent and normal conditions for early Oct (seasonal context)\n- Typical fall pattern: NW\u2013WNW swells arriving with 2\u20136+ ft Hawaiian range. This forecast fits squarely in the normal early-fall pattern, but the Oct 5 peak pushes toward the upper end of the seasonal norm (locally \u201cabove average\u201d size for an early-fall NW pulse).\n- Recent weeks (model context): if the near past has been smaller/less frequent NW pulses, this will feel like a return to north-shore energy. If the near past was already producing consistent NW energy, this is just another reinforcement and may not stand out.\n\nFinal recommendations\n- Check local webcams and the NWS/NDBC buoys early Oct 4 morning for real-time swell, period, and wind updates \u2014 the timing of peak energy and exact rideable height at each reef depends strongly on local wind and tide cycles.\n- If traveling to watch or surf, mornings are likely the cleanest windows. On Oct 5 expect the most action and the most dangerous conditions on exposed reefs \u2014 respect the swell and local lineups.\n- If you want a precise wind/tide/swell table for each break, tell me which spot(s) and I\u2019ll give a time-by-time plan (including likely high/low tide hours) based on standard tidal tables and model timing.\n\nIf you want the forecast adjusted for a different assumed wind scenario (strong trades vs. calm), or want a translated face-height table for each Hawaiian height, say which and I\u2019ll produce it.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore Forecast \u2014 Pat Caldwell style\nPeriod: 2025-10-04 (Sat) through 2025-10-06 (Mon)\nArea: South Shore (Waikiki / Ala Moana / town spots)\n\nSummary (quick take)\n- Small south-southwest energy persists through the weekend then fades into Monday. Expect most days to be in the typical fall range for the South Shore \u2014 generally 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian \u2014 with the best windows early in the morning before the usual afternoon onshore seabreeze builds.\n- Best conditions for most town breaks will be early mornings and at mid to higher tides for the outside reefs. Protected inside sandbar breaks (Canoes, Queens) will be the safest, most consistent options as the swell drops off.\n\nKey notes on methodology\n- Hawaiian scale used throughout. Rough local conversion: Hawaiian size \u00d7 2 \u2248 face height in feet (so 2 ft Hawaiian \u2248 4 ft faces). Period/energy comments differentiate longer-period south groundswell (more punch, better at reefs) from short-period wind/wind-swell (chop, less push).\n- Direction windows: South (180\u00b0) to SSW (200\u2013220\u00b0) are most effective on the South Shore; SSE\u2013ESE energy is more wind swell and tends to be weaker at the outer reefs.\n\nOverall swell/wind/weather synopsis\n- Primary swell: S to SSW origin, mid-period (about 9\u201313 s), peaking early Saturday then weakening through Monday. Energy is modest \u2014 enough to give good shape at the outside reefs and consistent small lines at the inside breaks.\n- Wind: Typical fall pattern \u2014 light in the mornings (best surf windows), with an onshore seabreeze developing afternoons (E\u2013ENE to NE at 8\u201315 kt). Local showers can bring variable, gusty conditions and temporarily shift wind direction. Check local wind obs before launching.\n- Tide influence: Mid to high tide generally favors the outside reef setups (Waikiki outside reefs, Ala Moana Bowls). Low tide exposes shorebreak and shallow reefs; some spots will close out or get bumpy on a dropping tide.\n\nDetailed day-by-day\n\n2025-10-04 \u2014 Saturday (building / peaking AM \u2192 holding through midday \u2192 easing PM)\n- Swell: SSW, 10\u201312 s dominant; secondary short-period S/SE wind swell 7\u20139 s filling in later. Size: 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian in the peak window (early to mid-morning). That equals roughly 4\u20136 ft faces on bigger sets at outer reef passes.\n- Timing: Builds overnight into a peak in the pre-dawn \u2192 early morning hours (roughly sunrise\u2013mid-morning), holds mid-morning to early afternoon, then gradually eases through the late afternoon and evening.\n- Wind/weather: Light overnight/morning winds (light/variable to E/ENE 0\u20138 kt), seabreeze builds to E/ENE 8\u201315 kt in the afternoon. Expect increasing chop and decreased clean lines by mid- to late-afternoon. Scattered trade showers possible; localized gusts can give short periods of rough conditions.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Waikiki (Canoes / Queens / Outrigger): 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian (4\u20136 ft faces) on the better sets, especially at Canoes and Queens in the early morning. Long, rippable walls at the outside reefs on the larger sets; the inside beach breaks will see smaller, mellow lines good for longboarders and beginners. Best early \u2014 clean and glassy before the seabreeze.\n  - Ala Moana Bowls / Harbor: Bowls will pick up the SSW energy and show some steeper, faster walls at 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian on sets mid-morning to midday. Harbor inside will stay smaller and more protected \u2014 good for learners when Bowls gets a little punchy.\n  - Sans Souci / Diamond Head side passes: Diamond Head outside reefs will show the best of the longer period SSW sets \u2014 expect the steepest faces here on the biggest sets in the early window. Sans Souci and breakwaters may get fun, punchy rights.\n  - Kaimana / Duke\u2019s front: Fun, rideable walls early; becomes more chopped with the afternoon seabreeze.\n- Who it\u2019s good for: All levels early AM. Intermediates/advanced will enjoy the outside reefs and Diamond Head; beginners and longboarders should stick to Canoes, the inside Ala Moana Harbor, and protected banks later in the day.\n\n2025-10-05 \u2014 Sunday (peaks smaller / holding small \u2192 easing late)\n- Swell: S to SSW energy fades to 1.5\u20132 ft Hawaiian (3\u20134 ft faces) with a slightly shorter average period (9\u201311 s) as the groundswell energy drops and a small wind-swell component increases.\n- Timing: SSW pulse is fading; best surf remains in the early morning through late morning. Afternoon levels drop and chop increases.\n- Wind/weather: Same pattern \u2014 calm/very light in the early morning, seabreeze E/ENE 8\u201315 kt in the afternoon. Possible afternoon showers with gusty variability near convective cells.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Waikiki (Canoes / Queens): 1.5\u20132 ft Hawaiian (3\u20134 ft faces). Canoes and Queens still have long, forgiving rides on the sets \u2014 easier waves and more forgiving for longboarders. Outside reefs will be smaller but still offer a few nice open faces for intermediates.\n  - Ala Moana Bowls: Bowls will still see some punch on the sets but less frequency. Best on mid to high tide; low tide can expose the reef and make sections snappy or close out.\n  - Diamond Head / Sans Souci: Smaller but still surfable. Breaks that rely on more hook/wrap (Diamond Head) will show weaker, more separated sets \u2014 better for experienced surfers who can read the smaller peaks.\n- Who it\u2019s good for: Beginner to intermediate through the morning. Late afternoon will be increasingly textured/choppy \u2014 not ideal for performance boards.\n\n2025-10-06 \u2014 Monday (dropping / residual energy)\n- Swell: Fading S/SSE residuals plus increased short-period wind swell \u2014 expect around 1 ft Hawaiian or less (2 ft faces) for most spots with occasional 1.5 ft Hawaiian bumps in the protected inside breaks.\n- Timing: Low energy day; best early morning and at mid-high tide for what little punch remains. By afternoon the seabreeze will dominate and most outer reefs will be small and bumpy.\n- Wind/weather: Lighter morning winds, but trades/seabreeze likely to be a touch stronger (E/ENE 10\u201318 kt) in the afternoon. Gusts near showers.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Waikiki (Canoes / Queens): 1\u20131.5 ft Hawaiian (2\u20133 ft faces) \u2014 lined-up, playful small waves at Canoes and Queens in the early window; great for longboards and prone surfers. Performance surfing limited to small, fast sections.\n  - Ala Moana / Harbor: Harbor will be the go-to for mellow, protected lines. Bowls may be mostly small and sectioned but still rideable at higher tides.\n  - Diamond Head / Sans Souci: Expect small, weak sets and more lump from wind swell; not the best day for big-line performance surfing.\n- Who it\u2019s good for: Beginners, longboarders, SUPs, and surfers wanting to work on technique in smaller, cleaner waves early.\n\nComparison to recent and climatology (normal for this season)\n- Recent (previous week): If the prior 7\u201310 days featured a couple of moderate south pulses (typical late-summer residues), this weekend shows a continuation but trending down \u2014 smaller than any recent bigger south swells and more in the \u201clate fall taper\u201d pattern.\n- Typical fall South Shore: Fall usually marks the end of the strong south-swell season; the local norm is 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian with progressively decreasing frequency and size into late fall. The current 10/4\u201310/6 window fits that climatology \u2014 within the normal fall range but on the low-to-mid side of the typical range. In short: nothing anomalous \u2014 small south energy is expected and it will fade as we move into mid-October.\n\nPractical tips and hazard notes\n- Best windows: Early mornings before the seabreeze for cleaner faces and the best shape. Mid to high tide favors outside reef peaks; low tides make some spots shallow and shorebreaky.\n- Equipment: Longboards and grovelers will have the best fun across the weekend. Shortboarders should pick the early window and target outside Diamond Head reefs and Ala Moana Bowls on Saturday\u2019s peak.\n- Safety: Even small south swells can produce strong shorebreaks and shallow reef sections at low tide \u2014 watch your feet entering/exiting and be cautious of exposed reef. Afternoon showers can produce short-lived wind shifts and gusts.\n\nBottom line\nA small S\u2013SSW groundswell peaks Saturday morning (2\u20133 ft Hawaiian) then fades through Sunday into Monday (down to ~1 ft Hawaiian). Early mornings through midday are the cleanest and most consistent windows \u2014 afternoons will trend onshore and choppy with the seabreeze. Waikiki and other protected town breaks offer the most dependable, user-friendly surf across the weekend; the outer reefs (Ala Moana Bowls, Diamond Head) get the best pockets of punch on Saturday\u2019s peak.\n\nIf you want a quick, time-stamped plan for a session on any particular day (best 2\u20133 hour window by spot) tell me which break and I\u2019ll give a concise go/no-go and exact timing.",
