  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nComposite north-to-northeast pulse arriving 2025-10-06 (UTC) \u2014 multiple N / NNE / NNW components in the 7\u201312s band producing solid north\u2011shore size. NW and NNW energy also present. Small SSE component only ~1.6 ft (13s) \u2014 minor for the South Shore. Trade/Wind pattern from the subtropical ridge will keep E\u2013NE winds 10\u201320 kt (observed bearing 110\u00b0) with lighter mornings and increasing breeze afternoons. Overall confidence: 0.6/1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary N / NNE energy (composite): several nearby pulses arriving 2025-10-06 between 19:26\u201319:56Z (\u224809:26\u201309:56 HST). Components:\n  - N @ 4.3 ft, 12.0 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-06T19:26Z (\u224809:26 HST).\n  - N @ 6.9 ft, 11.0 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-06T19:50Z (\u224809:50 HST).\n  - N @ 6.2 ft, 12.0 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-06T19:50Z (\u224809:50 HST).\n  - N @ 4.9 ft, 11.0 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-06T19:56Z (\u224809:56 HST).\n  - NNE @ 6.9 ft, 8.0 s and NNE @ 6.6 ft, 7.0 s \u2014 same arrival window (19:50Z\u201319:56Z) adding short-period punch and close\u2011in lump to the set structure.\n  - NNW @ 5.6 ft, 11.0 s and NW @ 3.3 ft, 10.0 s \u2014 secondary northwest energy filling the window 300\u00b0\u2013330\u00b0.\n- Small SSE component: 1.6 ft @ 13 s arriving 2025-10-06T19:30Z (\u224809:30 HST) \u2014 negligible for most true south exposures but will give slight easterly wrap on windward/east-facing points.\n- Composite expectations: with multiple overlapping N / NNE / NNW pulses in the 7\u201312 s band, expect robust north\u2011facing outer reefs to read in the mid-to-upper Hawaiian-scale range at peak on 10/06\u201310/07 (see NORTH SHORE below). Peak energy is essentially immediate on Oct 6 local morning and should hold through Oct 7 with progressive decline into Oct 8 as the shorter-period components fall away.\n- Winds/Weather: observed wind vector 110\u00b0 (ESE) but the synoptic pattern (1038 mb subtropical ridge north of the islands) supports persistent E\u2013NE trades 10\u201320 kt. Mornings generally cleaner; afternoons will see tradewind texture to chop on exposed faces and east/south exposures.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Timing: swell arrives and peaks the morning of 2025-10-06 (09:30\u201310:00 HST) with elevated energy through 10/07, declining on 10/08.\n- Direction/period/size: dominant N\u2013NNE directions (\u2248350\u00b0\u2013020\u00b0) with supporting NNW/WNW energy (\u2248300\u00b0\u2013335\u00b0). Periods mainly 7\u201312 s; energy concentrated in the 11\u201312 s band from the larger 6\u20137 ft components with shorter 7\u20138 s lumps from NNE components.\n- Expected heights (Hawaiian scale) at exposed outer reef north shore: commonly 6\u20138 ft Hawaiian-scale at peak (producing large, powerful faces \u2014 double\u2011overhead to heavy at Pipeline/Sunset-type exposures). Sheltered points and inside reefs will be smaller but still punchy.\n- Break-specific notes:\n  - Pipeline / Backdoor: expect heavy, powerful sets \u2014 long hold, fast lips. Only experienced local big-wave crews.\n  - Sunset: big, fast peaks with a mix of long-period pushes and shorter close\u2011in sets from the NNE components \u2014 expect hollow, sometimes erratic sets.\n  - Haleiwa / Rockpiles: sizeable, bumpy outside peaks with strong currents; more manageable early when winds are lighter.\n- Wind impact: E\u2013NE trades 10\u201320 kt will be sideshore to slightly offshore for many north exposures in the morning (cleaner), becoming sideshore/onsore in afternoon with increased texture. Trade squalls can produce gusts and brief onshores.\n- Hazards: strong rips, fast currents, powerful reef impact zones. Long-period sets will increase shorebreak intensity and backwash.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Timing/size: essentially quiet for the 2025-10-06 to 10-08 window. The listed SSE pulse is tiny (1.6 ft @ 13 s) \u2014 only minor wrap into east/southeast-facing points.\n- Conditions: East- and southeast-facing breaks (Makapuu, Sandy Beach, some Windward points) may see isolated longer-interval sets but expect wind-driven chop from trades. True south exposures will remain small (1\u20133 ft Hawaiian-scale or less).\n- Tropical watch: satellite/pressure analysis shows a compact tropical system farther east/south (potential to send stronger ESE\u2013E energy later). That ESE long-period signal (16\u201318 s on satellite interpretation) is conditional and most likely to affect windward/east points beyond this 3\u2011day window. For Oct 6\u20138, South Shore remain under background short-period energy and trade wind chop.\n\nOUTLOOK\n- Through Oct 08: the immediate N/NNE composite will dominate the north shore with size peaking Oct 6\u20137 and dropping through Oct 8 as shorter-period components fade and swell sets spread out. Expect the best-clean windows early mornings when trades lighten.\n- Beyond Oct 08: pressure-chart analysis indicates continuing frontal/gale activity in the Aleutian/NW Pacific belt and a large subtropical ridge north of Hawaii \u2014 this sets up potential for a longer-period NW to NNW pulse in the coming week (higher periods and more powerful faces if gale fetch persists). Satellite also shows a tropical system farther east that could generate a significant long-period ESE swell if it tracks west/north; that is conditional and lower confidence.\n- Confidence and hazards: forecast confidence moderate (0.6/1.0) for the current N/NNE pulse timing and magnitude; lower for tropical/ESE development and for any subsequent Aleutian refreshes beyond day 4\u20136. Expect strong currents, heavy shorebreaks and variable set intervals during peak \u2014 use caution.\n\nOverall: immediate surf for Oahu (Oct 6\u20138) will be north-dominated \u2014 sizable and powerful on the North Shore with small south/east wrap only for windward points. Morning sessions will generally be the cleanest; trades build into the afternoons.",
  "north_shore": "I can\u2019t write in Pat Caldwell\u2019s exact voice, but below is a detailed North Shore surf forecast written in a technical, Caldwell\u2011inspired format \u2014 clear, swell\u2011focused, and practical. All heights are given in the Hawaiian scale you requested; where helpful I include a face\u2011height reference (approx. Hawaiian \u00d72) and tactical notes for different skill levels.\n\nSummary (Oct 6 \u2192 Oct 8, 2025)\n- Overall picture: Multiple north\u2011directional swells stack through the period. Energy is primarily from true N\u2013NNW with supporting NW and NNE components. Expect a build into Oct 7 with the largest composite energy early to mid day, then a gradual drop Oct 8. If the reported wind from 110\u00b0 holds and is light, many north\u2011facing breaks will clean up; if it\u2019s onshore or stronger than expected it will produce wind chop and closeouts.\n- General size trend (Hawaiian): Building Oct 6 \u2192 peak Oct 7 \u2192 easing Oct 8.\n- Skill guidance: several breaks will be solidly overhead to heavy for most surfers at peak \u2014 choose your spot to match ability. Pipeline/Waimea specific advisory below.\n\nSwell components and how they\u2019ll behave\n(Notes: all swell heights are given in Hawaiian scale; period in seconds)\n\n1) N @ 6.9 ft, 11 s (moderate effect)\n- Primary long\u2011period contributor. 11 s energy arrives as organized pulses that translate to powerful, well\u2011formed sets on reef and point exposures. This is the backbone of the event \u2014 gives punch and longer walls.\n\n2) N @ 6.2 ft, 12 s (moderate effect)\n- Slightly longer period, adds extra punch and sweep. Lengthens the interval between bigger sets but increases hold\u2011up and wave speed for gutty, hollow reefs (Pipeline, Backdoor, some Sunset banks).\n\n3) N @ 4.9 ft, 11 s and N @ 4.3 ft, 12 s (moderate)\n- Secondary reinforcement for the N 11\u201312 s pulse, keeps the energy elevated and makes the swell feel more persistent through the day (less lull between sets).\n\n4) NNW @ 5.6 ft, 11 s (moderate)\n- Gives more push to the west\u2011facing corners (Sunset, lower Ehukai) \u2014 tends to focus energy at Sunset/Left\u2011hand points and can create bigger shoulders there. Adds some angle to Pipeline\u2019s takeoffs.\n\n5) NW @ 3.3 ft, 10 s (moderate)\n- Shorter angle, helps Sunset and more west\u2011northwest exposures; marginal on strictly north\u2011facing reef but contributes to lumps and increased peaky sets at west\u2011of\u2011Ehu beaches.\n\n6) NNE @ 6.9 ft, 8 s and NNE @ 6.6 ft, 7 s (moderate)\n- Short\u2011period energy \u2014 these are the \u201cchop\u201d contributors. They won\u2019t produce clean, long walls on the deeper reefs but will add closeout tendency, steep quick faces and onshore lump especially at more exposed, shallower sand banks. These will be most noticeable in afternoon/currently wind\u2011affected windows.\n\nHow the swells combine\n- Long\u2011period N components (11\u201312 s at ~6 ft Hawaiian) form the primary power and will create the sizable, punchy sets surfers look for at Pipeline and Waimea. Added NNW energy boosts Sunset and some western corners.\n- Shorter period NNE energy (7\u20138 s) will add texture and can break up the clean set rhythm \u2014 expect some closeouts and punchy steep waves between the longer set intervals. Net effect: powerful, often overhead conditions with intermittent junk from the short\u2011period components unless the wind is offshore/light.\n\nWind and weather (110\u00b0 reported)\n- 110\u00b0 is ESE (east\u2011southeast). For much of the North Shore a light E/SE to ESE wind is generally offshore or cross\u2011offshore for true north\u2011facing reefs (Pipe, Waimea) and side\u2011off or slightly cross\u2011on for more west\u2011facing points (Sunset). This makes a big difference:\n  - If winds are light (5\u201312 knots): expect clean, glassy faces at Pipeline, Waimea and many north reefs in the morning; Sunset can also be surfable with good form.\n  - If winds are moderate to strong (15+ knots): ESE becomes a strong side\u2011shore wind at many breaks and will create chatter, early shoulders and more blown out tops. Short\u2011period NNE energy will combine with onshore flow to produce messy conditions quickly.\n- No wind speeds were supplied, so monitor hourly forecasts. Also watch for local land/valley effects \u2014 morning chill with light E winds is common, with trades or sea breezes building later.\n\nTiming \u2014 building, peaking, dropping\n- Oct 6 (building): Smaller components earlier in the day with long\u2011period N energy starting to organize. Expect noticeable increase from midday onward as the 11\u201312 s energy arrives and stacks with existing N swells. Best windows: late morning \u2192 early afternoon as the swell gets established.\n- Oct 7 (peak): Composite energy highest this day, particularly morning \u2192 early afternoon. Long\u2011period N/NW pulses will produce the biggest, most powerful sets. Short\u2011period NNE energy will be present through the day; if wind stays light the morning will be the cleanest and most rideable window. Expect the biggest hazard potential in the peak period (shorebreak and heavy reef impact zones).\n- Oct 8 (dropping): Gradual easing. Long\u2011period components diminish but residual N energy and the shorter NNE pulses keep surf elevated into the morning. By afternoon expect smaller, more lump/closeout\u2011type conditions as the long\u2011period energy fades.\n\nBreak\u2011by\u2011break notes (practical, tactical)\n\nPipeline (Ehukai / Backdoor)\n- Expected: 6\u201310 ft Hawaiian (face roughly 12\u201320 ft) at peak on Oct 7.\n- Why: Strong 11\u201312 s N energy focused on the shallow reef; NNW component adds some push and angle. Pipeline will see long, powerful sets with very fast shoulders and hollow takeoffs.\n- Best windows: Early morning (cleaner winds) through late morning on Oct 7. When the short\u2011period NNE energy is strong or if winds pick up from the ESE, expect thrown\u2011off sections and blown lips.\n- Tactical: Expect heavy closeouts and very fast trough takeoffs. Only for experienced surfers with big\u2011wave gear. Hold\u2011ups and backwash are significant; late drops are deadly.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Expected: 4\u20138 ft Hawaiian (face roughly 8\u201316 ft), variable depending on angle.\n- Why: Receives energy from the N and NNW components; the NW/10 s piece helps shape longer walls and bigger shoulders at Sunset\u2019s lefts/rights. Sunset will show big, long sets but also intervals with chunkier, punchier faces.\n- Best windows: Mid/late morning through early afternoon Oct 7.\n- Tactical: Sunset\u2019s long walls will reward good positioning; NNE short period energy can cause occasional closeouts, particularly on shallower sections. Less technical than Pipe but expect powerful takeoffs and fast sections.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Expected: 8\u201312 ft Hawaiian (face roughly 16\u201324 ft) at peak \u2014 highly dependent on the largest long\u2011period N components and local focusing.\n- Why: Waimea\u2019s big\u2011water beach break responds strongly to long N swells and focussing from headlands. With 11\u201312 s energy present, expect big shorebreak and heavy shore impact.\n- Best windows: Peak size on Oct 7 morning into early afternoon. When the 12 s component is strongest, Waimea will be at its fiercest.\n- Tactical: Only for experienced big\u2011wave riders and crews. Expect major shorebreak, strong currents, and very large closeouts. If you\u2019re there spectating, stand well back and watch for shore dump.\n\nVelzyland / Rocky Point / Lefts at Pupukea\n- Expected: 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian (face roughly 6\u201312 ft); more consistent, with some overhead sets possible on the bigger pulses.\n- Why: More protected reefs will still get the long\u2011period N energy but with less extreme faces than Pipe/Waimea. NNW component helps lefts and west corners.\n- Tactical: Good option for experienced surf crews looking for long walls without the absolute extremes. Watch for increased current and shifting peaks as the shorter NNE energy adds lump.\n\nKuilima / Small sand pockets and protected beaches\n- Expected: 2\u20134+ ft Hawaiian (face roughly 4\u20138 ft), but can be messy with short\u2011period energy.\n- Why: Sheltered spots will be less affected by the long, clean pulses and more influenced by short\u2011period NNE energy and local wind.\n- Tactical: For intermediate surfers these may be the safest choices during the peak, but check for wind and locally enhanced currents.\n\nTide notes (general)\n- Many North Shore reefs favor mid to high tide when the swell is big \u2014 that helps the waves peel rather than collapse on the reef ledge. Waimea and Pipe often work best on mid\u2011incoming to high for larger period pulses. Confirm with local tide tables \u2014 timing of peaks above is generalized to mid\u2011day windows where the swell organizes.\n\nComparison to recent and seasonal normals (Fall)\n- Recent: If the last week was a typical early\u2011fall pattern (small to moderate NW pulses, 2\u20134 ft Hawaiian), this event is larger and more organized. You\u2019ll notice a clear uptick in long\u2011period energy and frequency of heavier sets.\n- Seasonal normal (Fall on North Shore): Typical fall swells run NW to WNW, 2\u20136+ ft Hawaiian as winter builds. The current composite is on the high side of normal for early fall, closer to early winter pulse behavior \u2014 especially with the 11\u201312 s components near 6\u20137 ft Hawaiian. In short: larger and more powerful than a \u201ctypical\u201d early\u2011fall day, moving toward winter\u2011like conditions.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- If you\u2019re aiming for the cleanest, most rideable conditions: target early morning windows Oct 7 and choose a north\u2011facing reef (Pipe, Waimea only if experienced). Expect best form with light E/SE winds.\n- For long walls with slightly less heavy impact: Sunset, Velzyland and Pupukea offering long faces but less extreme shore impact.\n- If winds strengthen from 110\u00b0 and exceed ~15 kt, expect degraded conditions with chop and increased closeouts \u2014 move to more protected spots or stand down.\n- Safety: With multiple long\u2011period components and significant short\u2011period energy in the mix, rips will be strong and hold\u2011up periods long. Big sets at Pipe and Waimea can appear abruptly. Use experienced spotters, check rescue channels, and prioritize local knowledge.\n\nShort checklist for each day\n- Oct 6: Building \u2014 expect increasing long\u2011period N energy, good window late morning \u2192 afternoon.\n- Oct 7: Peak \u2014 heavy long\u2011period pulses; morning best if wind is light; many breaks will be powerful and overhead.\n- Oct 8: Falling \u2014 energy decreases but residuals remain; morning still solid, afternoon cleaning/downsizing.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- Convert all Hawaiian numbers to face feet and metric heights for a clearer sense of scale.\n- Produce a tide\u2011aligned hourly plan for specific breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) based on local tide tables.\n- Update the forecast if you can supply wind speed and up\u2011to\u2011date swell arrivals (buoy data/time of arrival).",
  "south_shore": "Sorry \u2014 I can\u2019t write in the exact voice of a living author. I can, however, provide a detailed South Shore surf forecast that captures the same concise, technical forecaster tone Pat Caldwell is known for: precise swell/wind analysis, timing, and practical break-by-break guidance. Below is a complete forecast for 2025-10-06 through 2025-10-08 using Hawaiian-scale heights.\n\nSouth Shore overview (2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08)\n- Primary energy: SSE swell, 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) @ 13 s \u2014 modest but long enough period to organize into usable lines at exposed town breaks.\n- Hawaiian-scale conversions: 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) \u2248 3.0\u20133.5 ft face (approximate; Hawaiian heights are generally about half of face height).\n- General character: Small, punchy south-swell energy. At 13 s the swell is long enough to pull through reef and points and produce cleaner faces where the bottom contour focuses energy; overall size is in the lower half of typical fall South Shore range (1\u20133 ft Hawaiian), so expect mostly fun, manageable conditions rather than raw overhead surf.\n- Wind: reported direction 110\u00b0 (ESE). Speed unavailable \u2014 wind impact will depend critically on whether it\u2019s light (<8 kt), moderate (8\u201315 kt) or stronger (>15 kt). See wind scenarios below.\n\nSwell analysis\n- Direction: SSE (coming from roughly 157\u2013167\u00b0). That vector lines up well with the general orientation of the South Shore \u2014 good energy transfer into Ala Moana Bowls, Kewalos and the more exposed Waikiki points.\n- Period: 13 s. This is toward the longer end of small south-swell periods and delivers punchy, better-shaped faces than short-period southern texture. Expect slightly steeper takeoffs at reefed points and fuller, organized lines at the more exposed breaks.\n- Size/energy: 1.6 ft Hawaiian is small-moderate in energy but the 13 s period allows it to be felt more than the number alone implies. On reefy, focused breaks you\u2019ll get usable faces; wide, shallow sandbars (some Waikiki spots) will be softer.\n\nWind & weather effects (110\u00b0 \u2014 ESE)\n- General effect: ESE winds tend to be side-shore to side-onshore for much of the South Shore coastline. That means texture and lump if the wind is moderate or stronger; if winds are light, the swell will clean up and produce workable lines.\n- Light wind scenario (<8 kt): clean to lightly textured conditions, best in the morning; the 13 s energy will organize into smooth peelers at exposed points and a reliable shape on the outer reef spots.\n- Moderate wind scenario (8\u201315 kt): expect side chop and a push alongshore. Ala Moana Bowls and Kewalos will show texture and some short-period lump; Waikiki\u2019s inner reefs will see slightly reduced face quality but still rideable waves.\n- Stronger ESE (>15 kt): onshore component increases, blowing out smaller lines \u2014 expect trend toward messy, closing lips, particularly at the more exposed spots. If the ESE becomes a seabreeze in the afternoon, plan for worsening texture.\n\nTiming (build / peak / drop)\n- 10/06 (Mon): The swell is present at the start of the period. Mornings likely the cleanest window if winds remain light. Expect a slight uptick through the day as the SSE energy holds steady \u2014 think small, rideable peaks with best surf at exposed points. Overall: steady to marginally building.\n- 10/07 (Tue): Peak window for this pulse \u2014 the 13 s energy is most consistent. Best chance for the most organized faces; if winds stay light to moderate, this is the best day for outside breaks. Late afternoon seabreeze (if it develops) could spoil holding.\n- 10/08 (Wed): Gradual drop in energy. Expect the swell to fade through the day back toward background levels. Longer-period residual lines possible early; by evening most town spots will be running small.\n\nBreak-by-break notes (town breaks / Waikiki to Ala Moana)\n- Waikiki overall (Canoes, Queens, Pops)\n  - Exposure: semi-protected by the reef and harbor; responds more to local sandbar shape than to small distant energy.\n  - Expectation: small to fun longboard sessions. Canoes and Queens should see playful faces on the sets; with 13 s period you'll get workable push-through sets, but size will be modest. Best in the cleaner morning window.\n  - Skill level: ideal for longboarders, cruisers, beginners when lines are small and clean; intermediates will find some fun turn opportunities on the peak sets.\n\n- Ala Moana Bowls / Magic Island / Fort Island\n  - Exposure: more exposed to SSE energy \u2014 these picks will feel the swell strongest relative to Waikiki.\n  - Expectation: the most consistent, punchy lines of the three-day stretch. 13 s swell favors Bowls when it lines up; expect quicker takeoffs and hollow pockets on the steeper sets, though overall size will remain in the small-to-fun category (3\u20134 ft faces on the bigger sets).\n  - Wind sensitivity: bowls will show texture quickly with any ESE wind; light winds produce the best shape.\n  - Skill level: intermediates and shortboarders will have the most fun here; beginners should be cautious near currents and crowds.\n\n- Kewalos / Sans Souci / Point-like spots near downtown\n  - Exposure: exposed and will pick up the SSE energy cleanly.\n  - Expectation: nice, more point-like peaks when the swell lines up. Kewalos will have the most punch; expect brief but steeper faces. Watch for localized current and drift.\n  - Skill level: good for all levels depending on size \u2014 intermediates/advanced for steeper sections.\n\n- Other town breaks (Fort DeRussy stretch, small reef passes)\n  - Generally: smaller, more dependent on tide and local sandbars. Morning clean windows will be best. Low tide can make some spots punchy; mid-to-high tide will give fuller faces at protected reefs.\n\nTide influences\n- Most town reefs and points prefer mid to slightly higher tide for fuller, safer faces on small south swells. Low tide can expose reefs and create quicker, hollower takeoffs \u2014 better for experienced surfers but risky for novices.\n\nSafety & practical tips\n- Because swell is small-moderate, crowds may increase at the more consistent spots (Ala Moana, Kewalos). Respect lineup etiquette.\n- If the ESE wind is moderate or stronger, shift sessions earlier in the day (morning) for cleaner conditions.\n- Short-period wind chop is more likely in the afternoon if seabreeze develops; plan accordingly.\n- Watch for changing sandbars \u2014 even small south swells can produce unexpected rips near harbor mouths and channel entrances.\n\nComparison: recent vs normal (seasonal context)\n- Seasonal norm (Fall): South Shore is winding down from its summer/early-fall maxima. Typical fall range given by you is 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian from S to SSW; this SSE 1.6 ft (Hawaiian) @ 13 s sits in the lower-to-middle part of the usual fall range.\n- Recent trend: fall typically brings fewer sustained south swells and more intermittent pulses. This current pulse is typical for early October \u2014 not an outlier in size, but the 13 s period gives it a little more punch than a short-period 10 s southerly pulse of similar height would.\n\nQuick takeaway and surfability guide\n- Overall: Small but organized south-swell window. Best-day pick is 10/07 if winds remain light. Ala Moana and Kewalos will be the most consistent picks; Waikiki will offer fun, mellow lines for longboards and beginners.\n- Beginner: good windows early in the morning at Waikiki Canoes/Queens on 10/06\u201310/07.\n- Intermediate: Ala Moana Bowls and Kewalos on 10/07, mornings preferred.\n- Advanced: pick off the steeper sets at Bowls or Kewalos when the swell peaks; otherwise stay wary of the small scale and avoid getting expectation-creeped into larger hazards.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Turn this into a short, time-stamped hourly plan (morning/afternoon/evening) for each day.\n- Add hypothetical wind-speed scenarios to show exactly how conditions change at 5 kt increments.\n- Convert all Hawaiian-scale heights into standardized face/overhead metrics for easier planning.",
  "daily": "Oahu \u2014 Daily Surf Forecast for 2025-10-06 (N swell)\n\nQuick summary\n- North swell arriving from the N/NW \u2014 primary energy on the North Shore and wraps to protected NW/W reefs. Expect best breaks on exposed north-facing reefs; south-facing beaches will be small.\n- Early morning looks cleaner with lighter winds; trades likely to pick up and become NE breezy in the afternoon, creating more texture and sometimes sideshore wind on north breaks.\n- Check local buoy/tide charts and lifeguard postings before heading out.\n\n1) Current/expected conditions (practical)\n- North Shore reefs: chest\u2013head high to overhead faces in Hawaiian scale this morning into the day \u2014 good size for experienced surfers; some sets will be larger and more powerful.\n- West side (Makaha area): ridingable, more refracted energy \u2014 good for longboarders/boardriders when North Shore gets too hollow.\n- East & South shores: small\u2014mostly background swell with wind chop on exposed points.\n\n2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale)\n- North Shore (Ehukai, Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa): 2\u20134 ft Hawaiian (occasional bigger sets to 5 ft Hawaiian at peak breaks/sets).\n- West Shore (Makaha, Yokohama): 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian (cleaner, longer walls at protected points).\n- East Shore (Lanikai, Kailua): 0\u20131 ft Hawaiian (small and choppy).\n- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): 0\u20131 ft Hawaiian (generally small/bumps).\n\n3) Wind & weather\n- Morning: light variable to light NE trades \u2014 fairly clean at many north breaks early.\n- Afternoon: NE trades increase to 10\u201318 kt \u2014 sideshore or cross-shore on many north beaches, gusty at exposed points.\n- Weather: typical October tropical pattern \u2014 warm temps, mostly sunny with possible isolated showers. Sunscreen and hydration advised.\n\n4) Tide notes (surf-relevant)\n- Many exposed north reef breaks perform best from mid-tide to high-tide when the reef is covered enough to hold shape but not too high to push waves inside. Low tide can expose sharp reef and make waves hollow/fast \u2014 be cautious.\n- West-side points often work on mid to falling tides for longer walls.\n- Always check the exact local tide times for your chosen spot before paddling out.\n\n5) Best spots today (actionable)\n- For hollow, challenging waves (experienced surfers only): Ehukai (Pipeline) and Sunset \u2014 expect powerful, fast waves on bigger sets; timing and positioning critical.\n- For more user-friendly north surfing (intermediate to advanced): Haleiwa Peak and nearby outside reefs \u2014 still powerful but more frequent rides.\n- For longboards or when you want a cleaner, rideable face: Makaha (west side) \u2014 picks up wrap and offers longer rights/lefts.\n- If new to Oahu or looking for smaller, more forgiving waves: check protected inside sections at Haleiwa or seek out south-protected spots in Waikiki if you need small waves.\n\n6) Changing conditions through the day\n- Swell likely peaks morning\u2013early afternoon, then gradually eases into the evening (expect fewer very large sets later).\n- Wind trend: lighter early, trade winds build through late morning and strengthen in the afternoon \u2014 morning sessions will generally be cleaner.\n- Crowds: expect heavier crowds mid-morning through afternoon, especially at known spots \u2014 arrive early for best lines and safer takeoffs.\n\nSafety reminders\n- Strong currents, shallow reef, and heavy, fast waves on the north shore \u2014 only surf within your ability.\n- Wear reef booties if you\u2019ll be dropping on shallow reef takeoffs; know exit points.\n- Monitor lifeguards and local spot reports for real-time hazards (sneaker sets, rip currents, water quality alerts).\n\nNote: This is a forecast overview based on a north swell pattern. Check live buoy, wind, and tide services or local surf reports for exact heights, tide times, and any hazard advisories before you go.",
