    <h1>Hawaii Surf Forecast</h1>
    <div class="generated-date">Generated on October 04, 2025 at 11:33 </div>
    <div class="forecast-section">
        <h2>Main Forecast</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A strong long-period NW groundswell dominates the period beginning 2025-10-04 evening — NW energy to ~<strong>15–16 ft (Hawaiian)</strong> with 14 s period will light up the North Shore. Concurrent long-period southerly energy (SSE/SSW ~15 s, <strong>5–6 ft</strong> Hawaiian) provides a noticeable south component on the same day. Shorter-period ENE/E windswell (<strong>6–7 s</strong>, ~<strong>10–11 ft</strong> Hawaiian) and local E windseas will be present as trades strengthen. Early conditions may be relatively calm, but increasing easterly trades will degrade exposed lineups through the 5th–6th.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Primary NW groundswell: NW swell at 15.<strong>7 ft (Hawaiian)</strong> / 14 s — arrival/peak listed 2025-10-04T20:50:00Z. Direction ~NW (~310–320° true). This is the dominant energy for the North Shore; long-period, powerful faces and heavy shorebreak at exposed reef points.</li>
<li>Supplemental NNW component: NNW 6.<strong>6 ft</strong> / 10 s — arrival/peak 2025-10-04T20:26:00Z (NNW ~330°). Adds more punch and slightly different angle to the NW groundswell, increasing cross-swell at some spots.</li>
<li>Southern long-period energy: SSE 5.<strong>9 ft</strong> / 15 s and SSW 5.<strong>2 ft</strong> / 15 s — arrival/peak 2025-10-04T20:30:00Z. Low-angle long-period southerly pulse (roughly 160°–200°) will be noticeable on south-facing reefs and can create confused cross seas on exposed headlands.</li>
<li>East/ENE short-period swell / windsea: two ENE components 11.<strong>2 ft</strong> (<strong>6–7 s</strong>) and E components 10.<strong>5 ft</strong> (6 s) with arrivals ~2025-10-04T20:50–20:56:00Z. Direction ~E–ENE (70°–90°). These are wind-driven and will fill in east-facing breaks and make choppy conditions as trades increase.</li>
<li>Timing note: provided arrival/peak times are concentrated late on 2025-10-04 UTC (20:26–20:56Z). Expect surf to begin rising late Oct 4 (UTC) with highest faces on the North Shore from the late evening peak through the following daylight period; exact local high-face windows will depend on tide and local wind timing.</li>
<li>Sea state interaction: simultaneous NW groundswell, southerly long-period pulse, and E/ENE windsea will produce cross-seas and confused zones — choose protected reef or angled reef exposures for cleaner lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>North Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expect large, powerful surf: primary NW 14 s groundswell (15.<strong>7 ft</strong> Hawaiian) will produce heavy, long-period faces at the most exposed breaks. Pipeline–Ehukai: expect 15–20+ ft faces (Hawaiian scale shows <strong>15–16 ft</strong>; at Pipeline and Sunset this translates to very large, fast, hollow conditions). Haleiwa / Chuns: big, powerful reef with long, fat sections — expect heavy paddling/longboard impossible conditions at the exposed points.</li>
<li>Best windows: early on the rise after the swell arrives (late on 2025-10-04 UTC into the morning of 2025-10-05 UTC) while winds are still light from the ENE at 0 kt (initial data). However pressure analysis indicates trades will build — clean offshore windows likely brief.</li>
<li>Hazards: strong rip currents, massive shorebreak, and very hazardous hold-down potential at Pipeline/Sunset. Only experienced locals and competitors should consider the largest reefs.</li>
<li>Quality notes: where the NW energy can refract into WNW-facing coves, expect punchy, rideable sections; where the SSE/SSW long-period energy overlaps, expect more lump and less consistent barrels. East-trending trades will add onshore texture later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>South Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>South-facing breaks will see the SSE/SSW 15 s energy at <strong>5–6 ft (Hawaiian)</strong>. Not huge by summer standards, but long-period southerly push will produce cleaner, stronger sets at southern reefters (e.g., Ala Moana, Diamond Head) on favorable tide windows — expect occasional head-high+ sets on exposed points at peak times.</li>
<li>Because the dominant energy is NW, the South Shore will be secondary overall; but the long-period 15 s southerly component will stand out compared with a typical late-season fall drop-off.</li>
<li>Wind/windsea influence: east/ENE windswell (<strong>6–7 s</strong>, ~<strong>10–11 ft</strong> Hawaiian) combined with building trades will make exposed south corners and open beaches more mixed/choppy. Protected south-facing reefs and points will be the best options for cleaner rides.</li>
<li>Tidal timing: low tide early 2025-10-04 06:07Z (0.<strong>17 ft</strong>); favorable middle-tide windows later in the day will often produce the best shapes on reef points — check local tides for exact sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>OUTLOOK (beyond 2025-10-06)
- Synoptic drivers: pressure chart analysis shows a strong Aleutian storm (970 mb) and adjacent 999/1003 mb lows with a broad NW–WNW fetch in the northern Pacific. High confidence for continued long-period NW groundswell reinforcement 4–6 days after generation for Hawaii (expected 14–18+ s periods, directions ~315°–290°).
- Shorter-term reinforcement: central North Pacific frontal wave (40–48N) will add <strong>12–15 s</strong> NW/WNW energy arriving slightly earlier than the Aleutian peak — expect NW energy to remain elevated and possibly increase again later in the week.
- Local winds: a 1029–1031 mb high centered east of Hawaii will support strengthening easterly trades (subtropical highs also present). Expect trades and local windsea to increase through Oct 5–6, producing choppier east-facing and exposed north-facing spots. Cleaner windows will be limited to mornings or protected coves.
- Tropical note: TD 28W / TS Octave exists on charts — current analysis rates tropical contribution low-moderate. If these systems intensify or track northward they could deliver additional S–SSE energy several days out; monitor updates.
- Data limitation: satellite imagery could not be processed (unsupported image upload error). Forecasts above rely on pressure/wind charts and swell-generation analysis; confidence remains moderate-high for NW groundswell arrival and trade wind build.</p>
<p>Overall Forecast Confidence: 0.7/1.0</p>
<p>Brief practical guidance: expect large, long-period, hazardous NW surf on the North Shore from late 2025-10-04 into 10-05 with short, onshore-chopping ENE windswell developing as trades build. South Shore gets a modest long-period southern pulse but remains secondary. Check local tides and updated wind trends early morning each day before heading out.</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Disclaimer: Imitation of Pat Caldwell’s style — this is not a forecast issued by Pat Caldwell or Surfnews Network. I’m using the swell numbers you supplied but must flag missing/invalid inputs (periods are listed as 0 s and the wind line is inconsistent). I’ll state assumptions where I fill gaps so you know what’s data vs. inferred.</p>
<p>Quick summary (Oct 4 → Oct 6)
- Overall: Complex, multiple-direction swell mix with a dominant NW component and a persistent ENE/E windswell overlay. Expect raw, bumpy North Shore conditions in places; strong, organized sets at the exposed NW-facing reefs. This is larger-than-average for early October — trending toward early winter patterns.
- Main drivers: NW groundswell energy (primary), NNW wrap/secondary, and several moderate ENE/E windswell pulses. Because model periods weren’t provided I’m assuming the NW/NNW components are longer-period (<strong>12–18s</strong> range) and the ENE/E are short-period windswell (<strong>6–9s</strong>).
- Skill level: Solid intermediate+ to advanced conditions. Some breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) will see heavy, dangerous surf — only experienced riders/boat teams should consider those extremes.</p>
<p>What I’m assuming because your input is incomplete
- Periods: assumed <strong>12–18s</strong> for the NW/NNW components (groundswell), <strong>6–9s</strong> for the ENE/E components (windswell).
- Wind: “60 at 0 kt” appears to be corrupted. I’ll assume light ENE trades (roughly 60°) at 5–12 kt early, with potential for strengthening mid-day depending on the trade fetch. I’ll note where stronger trades would change the picture.
- Tides: no tide data supplied — I’ll include generic tide-window notes for each break.</p>
<p>Detailed day-by-day forecast</p>
<p>Saturday, 2025-10-04 — building / complicated
- Swell: NW/NNW groundswell energy is building through the day. Expect the NW component (<strong>15–16 ft</strong> Hawaiian equivalent in your data) to be the dominant contributor to large, spaced-out sets on the exposed reef breaks. Additional NNW pulses (<strong>14 ft</strong> H) will add to set frequency. ENE/E windswell (<strong>7–11 ft</strong> H range) will be superimposed, creating shorter-period junk between the long-period sets.
- Conditions: If trades hold light ENE (assumed 5–10 kt) the morning could be manageable at many breaks with some cross-offshore effect on the most north-facing reefs. As trades increase through the afternoon, expect onshore chop and a faster, more wind-affected surface at the beaches and points that get east exposure.
- Timing: Building overnight into the morning; expect steady size increase through the day with biggest sets arriving late afternoon into evening as the longer-period energy wraps into the shelf.
- Break-specific:
  - Pipeline (Ehukai): Large, powerful and contestable on the peaks. Expect hollow, heavy tubes on the biggest NW sets — hazardous. Best tide: mid to slightly lower tide frames the slabs; high tide will choke bowls and create punchy closeouts. Very experienced only — expect wash-throughs and strong backwash.
  - Sunset Beach: Long-period NW sets will create big, fast walls and steep drops. ENE windswell will add punchy closeout sets between the long-period intervals. High-to-mid tide will produce the best, overhaulable walls; low tide can expose shallow sections. Expect long, heavy rides but heavy wipeouts are likely.
  - Waimea Bay: Big surf day for Waimea — run-up overhead to double-overhead faces possible on the largest NW sets (depending on your actual period). Long-period energy will push into the bay; the peak could be busy with tow or experienced paddle crews. Boat operations and rescue teams should be on alert. Best at mid-tide.
  - Haleiwa / Chun’s / Velzyland: Big, powerful sets at the points — expect broad, ramping walls at Haleiwa; Hustling crowds. Points that wrap from NW will see best lines. Small-to-medium surfers should avoid the pass and heavy beacons.
  - Rocky Point / Off The Wall: Very heavy and technical. Expect fast, hollow peaks with strong currents. Only experts.
- Hazards: Strong rip currents, set wave overtopping, and heavy backwash/shorebreak. Given multiple swell directions expect confused, criss-crossed zones — unpredictable sets.</p>
<p>Sunday, 2025-10-05 — peak / raw
- Swell: This looks like the peak day for the NW/NNW mix. The 15.<strong>7 ft</strong> H NW component and the 14.<strong>4 ft</strong> H NNW component combine for powerful, continuous groundswell. The ENE/E short-period energy remains present, keeping the surface textured and shortening wave faces between sets.
- Conditions: Morning may offer the cleanest windows if trades remain light. If the ENE trades pick up &gt;12 kt, expect widespread onshore texture and a choppy surface — the cross-seas will make lineup spacing uneven and break timing less predictable.
- Timing: Peak through the day into evening. Night could remain large but typically dies slightly after the peak.
- Break-specific:
  - Pipeline: Peak day for heavy slabs. Expect very large, critical tubes — these are full commitment conditions. The break will close out quickly and shorebreak impact will be severe. Rescue teams on alert. Not for novices.
  - Sunset Beach: Large, long-period walls, fast sections and heavy runouts. Expect spectacular rides when the sets organize; also heavy, dangerous wipeouts. Best windows when tide is mid to high.
  - Waimea Bay: Potential for giant sets; big-wave protocol likely in effect. Tow and experienced big-wave teams only at the absolute peak. Mid tide into rising tide gives fastest run-ins; low tide exposes shallow reef — big hazard.
  - Intermediate breaks (e.g., Haleiwa): Expect long ramps and powerful sections — best for strong, experienced surfers. Some rip-dominated conditions near passes.
- Operational notes: Expect closures or advisories at the more exposed reefs if organizations monitor conditions. Lifeguards will be busy.</p>
<p>Monday, 2025-10-06 — easing but still raw
- Swell: The NW/NNW energy begins to drop, but multiple components and residual ENE/E windswell keep surf above average. Peaks may still run large in the morning; expect a measurable decrease through the day.
- Conditions: If trades remain light to moderate, the afternoon may become cleaner as shorter-period energy fades. If east trades hold, expect continued textured surface, especially on points and beach breaks.
- Timing: Decreasing through the day; long-period sets will space out more and the smaller windswell will be less dominant by evening.
- Break-specific:
  - Pipeline: Still big in the morning and for big sets, but fewer massive bombs as the NW energy drops. Expect a cleaner mid/late day window if winds back off.
  - Sunset Beach: Long walls early, easing into more manageable size later. Best runs likely in the morning to mid-day.
  - Waimea Bay: Dropping — still big but not as sustained as peak day. Watch for leftover sets; surf will remain hazardous for all but experienced big-wave teams.
  - Smaller north-facing points: Easing to large-plus and more ridable lines for experienced surfers.</p>
<p>Swell direction &amp; period analysis (technical)
- Directional mix: Primary energy from NW (dominant) with NNW wrap and secondary ENE/E short-period energy. The NW/NNW arrivals will refract and wrap into the northwest-facing reef systems (Pipeline → Sunset → Waimea) and create large, steep faces. The ENE/E component is good at shallow, east-exposed beaches and will shorten faces and create closeouts in between long-period sets.
- Period assumption effect: If the NW components are longer-period (<strong>14–18s</strong>) the reefs will see powerful, widely spaced sets with high energy and long run-ups — big, hollow barrels at Pipeline and long walls at Sunset. If periods are shorter (&lt;12s), expect punchier, faster-breaking waves that close out more. Because periods weren’t provided, treat the scenario as worst-case (long-period energy) for safety planning.
- Cross-seas: Mixed directions create confused, lumpy lines and unpredictable set arrivals. Expect cross-whipping wind chop where ENE/E windswell overlaps the NW groundswells.</p>
<p>Wind and weather effects (North Shore specifics)
- East to ENE trades (common in fall) will produce variable effects:
  - Light ENE (5–10 kt): can be near-offshore at many north-facing reefs in the morning — cleaner faces.
  - Moderate ENE (12–18 kt): creates onshore texture and shortens the face — surf goes lumpier and wind chop increases.
  - Stronger northwesterlies (&gt;15 kt): would steepen faces and add wind chop to the already large sets.
- Local micro-effects: Points like Haleiwa and Rocky Point will feel different than the central Ehukai-Pipeline complex. Topography and headland shelter will alter wind at each break — check local cams early AM.
- Weather: Unknown from supplied data. Any low-level frontal passage or local squall can rapidly alter wind direction/intensity and swell period.</p>
<p>Tide and run-up considerations (general)
- Pipeline/Off The Wall: Best mid to lower-mid tides for the classic slabs, but timing is critical — too low and reefs expose, too high and bowls choke.
- Sunset: Performs across a range of tides; mid to high often yields the best ramping walls.
- Waimea: Prefers mid to rising tide for big compressions on run-ins; extreme low tide increases reef hazard.
- Small/point breaks: Low tides can accelerate steeper takes; high tide may mellow some peaks.</p>
<p>Comparison to recent and seasonal norms
- Recent: If the North Shore has been in a quieter, early-fall mode (typical <strong>2–6 ft</strong> H), this pulse is a clear step up — larger than recent early-fall days. Multiple overlapping components add the rawness that normally arrives later in fall/early winter.
- Seasonal/normal (typical fall): Fall on the North Shore is a transition to NW-dominant swells. Your provided heights (multiple components in double-digit Hawaiian scale) are on the high side for early fall and are closer to early winter surf levels. Expect a shift from the smaller, intermittent NW arrivals of early fall toward a more consistent NW groundswell pattern as winter approaches.</p>
<p>Practical advice and safety
- Check updated buoy periods and local cams before paddling — the period assumptions matter a lot for hazard and surf quality.
- If you’re not experienced on hollow north reefs: pick a protected break or sit this out. Strong rips, backwash, and shore impact are significant hazards.
- For big-wave teams: confirm tow/rescue presence at Waimea and coordinated safety plans at Pipeline/Sunset.
- For spectators: expect dramatic visuals and potential closures; keep clear of shorebreak zones.</p>
<p>If you want, I can:
- Re-run this forecast using actual buoy periods and a corrected wind read (please supply buoy IDs or the correct wind vector), or
- Produce a shorter “surf plan” with best launch windows, exact tide targets and safest entry points for a chosen break.</p>
<p>Would you like me to update this with real-time buoy periods and a corrected wind observation?</p>

            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Overview (Oct 4 – Oct 6, 2025)
- Quick take: Data provided has gaps (no swell periods; wind given as 60° at 0 kts). Working from the provided swell magnitudes and direction vectoring plus typical South Shore seasonal behavior, there are two southerly components present — SSE and SSW — that will be the drivers. If the listed numbers (SSE 5.<strong>9 ft</strong> Hawaiian, SSW 5.<strong>2 ft</strong> Hawaiian) are accurate, this is a well-above-normal southerly pulse for early October and will produce very large, powerful South Shore surf at exposed reefs and points. If those magnitudes are actually erroneous (common when periods/sources are missing), conditions may be closer to the normal Fall range (<strong>1–3 ft</strong> Hawaiian). I’ll give a main forecast assuming the numbers are correct, note the uncertainties, and provide practical, break-specific guidance.</p>
<p>Key assumptions and conversions
- Hawaiian scale to face height: face ≈ 2 × Hawaiian. So:
  - SSE 5.<strong>9 ft</strong> (Haw) → faces ~ 11.<strong>8 ft</strong>
  - SSW 5.<strong>2 ft</strong> (Haw) → faces ~ 10.<strong>4 ft</strong>
- Periods were not supplied (0.0 s). Period matters: long-period (<strong>12–16 s</strong>) southern hemisphere groundswells will be far punchier and more powerful on reefs/points than short-period (&lt;10 s) local wind swells. I’ll present two period scenarios where it changes the surf character.
- Wind listed as 60° at 0 kts: interpret as light/variable with a preferred trade direction from the ENE (roughly 060°). Calm/very light winds are favorable for clean morning conditions on the South Shore; expect typical afternoon seabreezes to fill in from the E–NE in absence of synoptic pressure gradients.</p>
<p>Swell analysis (direction, size, period scenarios)
- Direction: SSE (S 157°) and SSW (S 200–210°). Both are within the South Shore window (S to SSW is prime for this season). The two components are close enough that many south-facing reefs and points will feel combined energy; certain orientations will favor one component over the other (more easterly facing reefs favor SSE, more westerly-facing points favor SSW).
- Magnitude: Listed as 5.<strong>9 ft</strong> and 5.<strong>2 ft</strong> Hawaiian. If correct, that is a large southerly pulse for early October — well above the Fall norm (see comparison below).
- Period scenarios (periods not supplied; choose likely ranges):
  - Long-period case (<strong>12–16 s</strong>): energy is organized, deep-water groupiness will translate efficiently onto shelf and reef contours. Expect strong, clean faces, long walls, heavy lips on reef breaks, and favorable setup for outer reefs/points to hold very large, rideable faces. Hold and punchy takeoffs at Bowls-type breaks (Ala Moana Bowls, some Waikiki outer reefs).
  - Short-period case (<strong>6–10 s</strong>): more wind-swell character. Surf will be steeper, punchier, less organized. Beachbreaks and inner reef spots will see big push but shorter rides and more dumping. Power is more surface-level; less danger of extreme sets at deep-water refracting reefs, but still heavy.</p>
<p>Timing (building / peaking / dropping)
- Oct 4 (Sat): Expect swell energy to be present and building in the first half of the day. Morning will be cleaner (light winds). If these swells are long-period groundswell, the bulk of energy will push in and the South Shore will be on the upswing through the day.
- Oct 5 (Sun): Peak day for the pulse — either the highest tide of energy or close to it. If two southerly components phase constructively at certain spots, expect the largest, most powerful conditions on this date.
- Oct 6 (Mon): Gradual drop. Energy will still be elevated compared with seasonal norms into the morning, but by late Mon the swell should be trending down. The rate of drop depends on storm fetch persistence; without long-period sustain (i.e., if these are short-period local swells), the decrease will be quicker.</p>
<p>Wind &amp; weather effects (South Shore specifics)
- Morning: calm to light winds. With the listed 0 kts, mornings should be clean and glassy — best window for all levels.
- Afternoon: typical Fall behavior brings seabreezes from the E–ENE (060–090°). On the South Shore, that often creates onshore to cross-onshore wind at many spots by mid/late morning into afternoon, increasing chop and blowing out the most exposed peaks.
- Local shading: Waikiki’s inner reefs can be protected from small ENE breezes early, but sustained afternoon trades will push chop into the lineup.
- Weather uncertainty: no synoptic info provided; if a surface low rides near the islands it can flip winds and increase local wind swell; monitor updates.</p>
<p>Break-by-break detail (town spots / notable South Shore breaks)
Note: “Hawaiian scale” sizes below; face conversions in parentheses. Use conservative interpretations for each break based on long- vs short-period scenarios.</p>
<p>Waikiki complex (Canoes, Queens, Pops, etc.)
- If long-period swell: Outer reefs (Pops, Queens) will see long, powerful open-face walls — faces in the <strong>10–12 ft</strong> range on the outer sets (<strong>5–6 ft</strong> Haw). Canoes (the long rolling peak) will have very long rides on the bigger sets but expect heavy takeoffs and tricky entrances. Crowds will be selective — mostly advanced riders on the largest sets.
- If short-period swell: Waikiki will get punchy, fast waves; inner reefs and the shoreline will see more closeouts. Canoes may still run but with shorter, quicker walls.</p>
<p>Ala Moana Bowls / Magic Island
- Long-period: Ala Moana Bowls could be raw — heavy reef bowls with big lips and long faces (expect hollow, reefy sections). The channel will increase current and funneling; bigger water volumes through the bowl can make it dangerous. Advanced-only; expect long hold/critical sections.
- Short-period: Bowls will be less organized but still heavy — expect quicker, punchier barrels that close out on the inside.</p>
<p>Kewalo Basin / Kakaʻako shorebreaks
- Exposed to southerly energy but also influenced by local bathymetry. Long-period swell will create big, powerful beachbreak sets that can jack up quickly and close out. Short-period swell: steep dumpy sets. Watch for strong shorebreak and powerful shoreward current.</p>
<p>Sans Souci / eastward-facing pocket reefs
- Less directly in the SSW axis and may pick up more of the SSE component. Expect powerful but slightly less size than the most exposed points. In a long-period case, expect firm, rideable walls; in the short-period case, expect punchy, fast sections.</p>
<p>General surf character and hazards
- If the swells are truly <strong>5–6 ft</strong> Hawaiian: This is a large, powerful event — reef breaks will be very big, currents will be strong, and hold-down risk is significant. Spot-dependent: outer reefs and points will steepen and produce critical sections; inside sandbars and channels will be rippier.
- Crowds: Selective lineup — experienced localism and strong surfer skill required on the largest sets.
- Safety: Watch channels, rip currents, and the increased volume of water funneling through cuts around Magic Island and Ala Moana. Leashes, local knowledge, and respect for conditions are essential.
- Beginner/intermediate guidance: Avoid exposed reefs and points above ~<strong>3 ft</strong> Hawaiian. If uncertain about actual swell magnitude, opt for protected inner reefs or smaller breaks in the morning when winds are light.</p>
<p>Comparison to recent and normal Fall conditions
- Normal Fall pattern (early October): South to SSW groundswells typically <strong>1–3 ft</strong> Hawaiian with fading frequency as the southern-hemisphere season wanes. Mornings are usually clean with trades building in the afternoon.
- Comparison: If the supplied <strong>5–6 ft</strong> Hawaiian numbers are accurate, this event is well above normal for this time of year — roughly 2–4× the typical energy levels. That would be an unusually large late-summer/early-fall southerly pulse.
- If the supplied magnitudes are an over-read or missing period information indicates short, local wind swell, conditions may be only modestly above-normal or right in the typical Fall <strong>1–3 ft</strong> Hawaiian range.</p>
<p>Practical recommendations (by skill level)
- Advanced/Pro: Expect powerful, hollow, long-period walls on reefs and points in the morning. Choose break based on preferred style (long-wall Waikiki outer reefs vs. heavy bowls at Ala Moana). Be mindful of set intervals and increased current near channels.
- Intermediate: Stick to more protected sections, surf morning glass, and avoid the outside sets at big reef breaks. Use longer boards for paddling and positioning on the longer-period option.
- Beginner: Sit this one out if the swell is near the listed magnitudes. If uncertain and actual surf is small (<strong>1–3 ft</strong> Haw), choose shallow, protected beach breaks in the morning with supervision.</p>
<p>Bottom line / actionable summary
- Primary driver: Two southerly components (SSE and SSW). Provided magnitudes indicate a strong pulse — much larger than normal for early Oct — but periods were not supplied. Period will determine whether this is punchy/closer to wind-swell character (short period) or an organized groundswells (long period) that will punish exposed reefs and create long, powerful faces.
- Best window: Mornings each day (Oct 4–6) while winds are light; afternoons trend windier and choppier with typical seabreeze filling in.
- Expect the swell to build Oct 4, probably peak Oct 5, and ease Oct 6 — monitor updated buoy and model period data to refine the forecast and safety decisions.
- If you’re heading out, get updated period readings from the NN or local buoy and heed local lifeguards — these numbers imply a very powerful South Shore if they’re correct.</p>
<p>If you want, I can:
- Re-run this with assumed period values (e.g., 10 s, 14 s) and give exact expected face heights at individual spots, or
- Pull the latest buoy and model output to replace the missing period and wind-speed data and produce a tightened, time-of-day surf table for each break.</p>

        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>Short note: I don’t have live data for 2025-10-04. Below is a practical, surfer-focused forecast scenario for Oahu assuming a NW swell hits that day. Treat this as guidance — check Surfline/NOAA buoys, local cams and tide charts before heading out.</p>
<p>1) Snapshot (today, NW swell scenario)
- Morning: likely the cleanest — light winds, glassy windows before trades build.
- Midday → afternoon: trades usually pick up, making conditions bumpier on exposed breaks.
- Overall: NW swell will favor North and West exposures; South and East shores will be much smaller/protected.</p>
<p>2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale) — expected ranges
(Note: Hawaiian scale roughly reports about half the face height. Face height ≈ Hawaiian × 2.)
- North Shore (Ehukai/Sunset/Waimea zone): <strong>3–6 ft</strong> Hawaiian (faces ~<strong>6–12 ft</strong>) — size depends on swell energy; bigger sets toward Sunset/Waimea if the swell is strong.
- West Shore (Makaha, Nanakuli, Ka'ena point): <strong>3–7 ft</strong> Hawaiian (faces ~<strong>6–14 ft</strong>) — West gets very direct NW energy; expect hollow peaks on exposed points.
- South Shore (Waikiki/Ala Moana): <strong>1–2 ft</strong> Hawaiian (faces ~<strong>2–4 ft</strong>) — generally small, broken wind swell only.
- East Shore (Sandy's/Pupukea east-facing coves): <strong>1–2 ft</strong> Hawaiian (faces ~<strong>2–4 ft</strong>) — little direct energy from NW swell.</p>
<p>3) Wind &amp; weather (likely pattern)
- Morning: light variable winds (best window for offshore/clean lines).
- Late morning → afternoon: trades 10–20+ kt from NE–E are common in October — cross-onshore for NW/West exposures (choppy for west in afternoon).
- Typical temps: mid-to-upper 70s–80°F ocean; possible scattered showers with NE trades.
- Action: aim for the early-morning glassy window; avoid late-afternoon on exposed west breaks if trades strengthen.</p>
<p>4) Tides (general, surf-relevant guidance)
- Many reef breaks on North/West perform best on mid → high tides (cleaner takeoffs, less exposed reef).
- Low tides increase shallow reef hazards and can make waves break too fast/close out at some spots.
- Action: consult the local tide chart for 2025-10-04. Plan sessions around mid-tide/high-tide windows for exposed reef points; at exposed shallow breaks, avoid lowest tides.</p>
<p>5) Best spots today (based on NW swell and skill level)
- For advanced/expert (big, hollow NW energy): Sunset Beach, Ehukai (Banzai/Pipeline only if big and in-shape), Waimea (if the swell is large), Makaha for powerful west-facing peaks.
- Intermediate: West-facing points on milder parts of the west shore (smaller sets at Nanakuli), some protected reefs on the northwest that hold shape on moderate size.
- Beginner / mellow session: Waikiki/Ala Moana or south-facing protected coves — much smaller and safer when NW swell is up.
- Local note: if swell is big, many north reefs will be crowded with big-wave surfers; pick your spot based on skill &amp; local conditions.</p>
<p>6) Changing conditions through the day (what to watch)
- Early morning: best window — cleaner, lighter winds, less crowd.
- Late morning/afternoon: trades tend to increase, creating cross/on-shore wind and chop on exposed NW/West breaks.
- Swell evolution: NW swells can pulse — check buoy reports: heights can increase with incoming sets or drop if the storm energy fades. Watch for occasional larger sets (sneaker sets) and rapid shorebreak/reefall changes.
- Safety: currents and rips intensify with larger sets; monitor changing lines and talk to locals/guards if unsure.</p>
<p>Quick checklist before you go
- Check live swell height/period and buoy reports (NDBC, Surfline).
- Verify exact tide times for your chosen spot.
- Confirm wind forecast (morning vs afternoon).
- Bring appropriate gear: reef booties for shallow reefs, leash, helmet for big/rocky breaks if applicable.
- If unsure of conditions, pick a protected south-facing spot or consult lifeguards.</p>
<p>If you want, I can produce a tighter “if the swell is X ft at buoy Y” style forecast — tell me the NW swell size/period or share a buoy reading and I’ll convert into Hawaiian scale and recommend exact spots/tide windows.</p>
