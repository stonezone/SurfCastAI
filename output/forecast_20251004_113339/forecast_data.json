  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nA strong long-period NW groundswell dominates the period beginning 2025-10-04 evening \u2014 NW energy to ~15\u201316 ft (Hawaiian) with 14 s period will light up the North Shore. Concurrent long-period southerly energy (SSE/SSW ~15 s, 5\u20136 ft Hawaiian) provides a noticeable south component on the same day. Shorter-period ENE/E windswell (6\u20137 s, ~10\u201311 ft Hawaiian) and local E windseas will be present as trades strengthen. Early conditions may be relatively calm, but increasing easterly trades will degrade exposed lineups through the 5th\u20136th.\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary NW groundswell: NW swell at 15.7 ft (Hawaiian) / 14 s \u2014 arrival/peak listed 2025-10-04T20:50:00Z. Direction ~NW (~310\u2013320\u00b0 true). This is the dominant energy for the North Shore; long-period, powerful faces and heavy shorebreak at exposed reef points.\n- Supplemental NNW component: NNW 6.6 ft / 10 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-04T20:26:00Z (NNW ~330\u00b0). Adds more punch and slightly different angle to the NW groundswell, increasing cross-swell at some spots.\n- Southern long-period energy: SSE 5.9 ft / 15 s and SSW 5.2 ft / 15 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-04T20:30:00Z. Low-angle long-period southerly pulse (roughly 160\u00b0\u2013200\u00b0) will be noticeable on south-facing reefs and can create confused cross seas on exposed headlands.\n- East/ENE short-period swell / windsea: two ENE components 11.2 ft (6\u20137 s) and E components 10.5 ft (6 s) with arrivals ~2025-10-04T20:50\u201320:56:00Z. Direction ~E\u2013ENE (70\u00b0\u201390\u00b0). These are wind-driven and will fill in east-facing breaks and make choppy conditions as trades increase.\n- Timing note: provided arrival/peak times are concentrated late on 2025-10-04 UTC (20:26\u201320:56Z). Expect surf to begin rising late Oct 4 (UTC) with highest faces on the North Shore from the late evening peak through the following daylight period; exact local high-face windows will depend on tide and local wind timing.\n- Sea state interaction: simultaneous NW groundswell, southerly long-period pulse, and E/ENE windsea will produce cross-seas and confused zones \u2014 choose protected reef or angled reef exposures for cleaner lines.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Expect large, powerful surf: primary NW 14 s groundswell (15.7 ft Hawaiian) will produce heavy, long-period faces at the most exposed breaks. Pipeline\u2013Ehukai: expect 15\u201320+ ft faces (Hawaiian scale shows 15\u201316 ft; at Pipeline and Sunset this translates to very large, fast, hollow conditions). Haleiwa / Chuns: big, powerful reef with long, fat sections \u2014 expect heavy paddling/longboard impossible conditions at the exposed points.\n- Best windows: early on the rise after the swell arrives (late on 2025-10-04 UTC into the morning of 2025-10-05 UTC) while winds are still light from the ENE at 0 kt (initial data). However pressure analysis indicates trades will build \u2014 clean offshore windows likely brief.\n- Hazards: strong rip currents, massive shorebreak, and very hazardous hold-down potential at Pipeline/Sunset. Only experienced locals and competitors should consider the largest reefs.\n- Quality notes: where the NW energy can refract into WNW-facing coves, expect punchy, rideable sections; where the SSE/SSW long-period energy overlaps, expect more lump and less consistent barrels. East-trending trades will add onshore texture later.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- South-facing breaks will see the SSE/SSW 15 s energy at 5\u20136 ft (Hawaiian). Not huge by summer standards, but long-period southerly push will produce cleaner, stronger sets at southern reefters (e.g., Ala Moana, Diamond Head) on favorable tide windows \u2014 expect occasional head-high+ sets on exposed points at peak times.\n- Because the dominant energy is NW, the South Shore will be secondary overall; but the long-period 15 s southerly component will stand out compared with a typical late-season fall drop-off.\n- Wind/windsea influence: east/ENE windswell (6\u20137 s, ~10\u201311 ft Hawaiian) combined with building trades will make exposed south corners and open beaches more mixed/choppy. Protected south-facing reefs and points will be the best options for cleaner rides.\n- Tidal timing: low tide early 2025-10-04 06:07Z (0.17 ft); favorable middle-tide windows later in the day will often produce the best shapes on reef points \u2014 check local tides for exact sessions.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 2025-10-06)\n- Synoptic drivers: pressure chart analysis shows a strong Aleutian storm (970 mb) and adjacent 999/1003 mb lows with a broad NW\u2013WNW fetch in the northern Pacific. High confidence for continued long-period NW groundswell reinforcement 4\u20136 days after generation for Hawaii (expected 14\u201318+ s periods, directions ~315\u00b0\u2013290\u00b0).\n- Shorter-term reinforcement: central North Pacific frontal wave (40\u201348N) will add 12\u201315 s NW/WNW energy arriving slightly earlier than the Aleutian peak \u2014 expect NW energy to remain elevated and possibly increase again later in the week.\n- Local winds: a 1029\u20131031 mb high centered east of Hawaii will support strengthening easterly trades (subtropical highs also present). Expect trades and local windsea to increase through Oct 5\u20136, producing choppier east-facing and exposed north-facing spots. Cleaner windows will be limited to mornings or protected coves.\n- Tropical note: TD 28W / TS Octave exists on charts \u2014 current analysis rates tropical contribution low-moderate. If these systems intensify or track northward they could deliver additional S\u2013SSE energy several days out; monitor updates.\n- Data limitation: satellite imagery could not be processed (unsupported image upload error). Forecasts above rely on pressure/wind charts and swell-generation analysis; confidence remains moderate-high for NW groundswell arrival and trade wind build.\n\nOverall Forecast Confidence: 0.7/1.0\n\nBrief practical guidance: expect large, long-period, hazardous NW surf on the North Shore from late 2025-10-04 into 10-05 with short, onshore-chopping ENE windswell developing as trades build. South Shore gets a modest long-period southern pulse but remains secondary. Check local tides and updated wind trends early morning each day before heading out.",
  "north_shore": "Disclaimer: Imitation of Pat Caldwell\u2019s style \u2014 this is not a forecast issued by Pat Caldwell or Surfnews Network. I\u2019m using the swell numbers you supplied but must flag missing/invalid inputs (periods are listed as 0 s and the wind line is inconsistent). I\u2019ll state assumptions where I fill gaps so you know what\u2019s data vs. inferred.\n\nQuick summary (Oct 4 \u2192 Oct 6)\n- Overall: Complex, multiple-direction swell mix with a dominant NW component and a persistent ENE/E windswell overlay. Expect raw, bumpy North Shore conditions in places; strong, organized sets at the exposed NW-facing reefs. This is larger-than-average for early October \u2014 trending toward early winter patterns.\n- Main drivers: NW groundswell energy (primary), NNW wrap/secondary, and several moderate ENE/E windswell pulses. Because model periods weren\u2019t provided I\u2019m assuming the NW/NNW components are longer-period (12\u201318s range) and the ENE/E are short-period windswell (6\u20139s).\n- Skill level: Solid intermediate+ to advanced conditions. Some breaks (Pipeline, Sunset, Waimea) will see heavy, dangerous surf \u2014 only experienced riders/boat teams should consider those extremes.\n\nWhat I\u2019m assuming because your input is incomplete\n- Periods: assumed 12\u201318s for the NW/NNW components (groundswell), 6\u20139s for the ENE/E components (windswell).\n- Wind: \u201c60 at 0 kt\u201d appears to be corrupted. I\u2019ll assume light ENE trades (roughly 60\u00b0) at 5\u201312 kt early, with potential for strengthening mid-day depending on the trade fetch. I\u2019ll note where stronger trades would change the picture.\n- Tides: no tide data supplied \u2014 I\u2019ll include generic tide-window notes for each break.\n\nDetailed day-by-day forecast\n\nSaturday, 2025-10-04 \u2014 building / complicated\n- Swell: NW/NNW groundswell energy is building through the day. Expect the NW component (15\u201316 ft Hawaiian equivalent in your data) to be the dominant contributor to large, spaced-out sets on the exposed reef breaks. Additional NNW pulses (14 ft H) will add to set frequency. ENE/E windswell (7\u201311 ft H range) will be superimposed, creating shorter-period junk between the long-period sets.\n- Conditions: If trades hold light ENE (assumed 5\u201310 kt) the morning could be manageable at many breaks with some cross-offshore effect on the most north-facing reefs. As trades increase through the afternoon, expect onshore chop and a faster, more wind-affected surface at the beaches and points that get east exposure.\n- Timing: Building overnight into the morning; expect steady size increase through the day with biggest sets arriving late afternoon into evening as the longer-period energy wraps into the shelf.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Pipeline (Ehukai): Large, powerful and contestable on the peaks. Expect hollow, heavy tubes on the biggest NW sets \u2014 hazardous. Best tide: mid to slightly lower tide frames the slabs; high tide will choke bowls and create punchy closeouts. Very experienced only \u2014 expect wash-throughs and strong backwash.\n  - Sunset Beach: Long-period NW sets will create big, fast walls and steep drops. ENE windswell will add punchy closeout sets between the long-period intervals. High-to-mid tide will produce the best, overhaulable walls; low tide can expose shallow sections. Expect long, heavy rides but heavy wipeouts are likely.\n  - Waimea Bay: Big surf day for Waimea \u2014 run-up overhead to double-overhead faces possible on the largest NW sets (depending on your actual period). Long-period energy will push into the bay; the peak could be busy with tow or experienced paddle crews. Boat operations and rescue teams should be on alert. Best at mid-tide.\n  - Haleiwa / Chun\u2019s / Velzyland: Big, powerful sets at the points \u2014 expect broad, ramping walls at Haleiwa; Hustling crowds. Points that wrap from NW will see best lines. Small-to-medium surfers should avoid the pass and heavy beacons.\n  - Rocky Point / Off The Wall: Very heavy and technical. Expect fast, hollow peaks with strong currents. Only experts.\n- Hazards: Strong rip currents, set wave overtopping, and heavy backwash/shorebreak. Given multiple swell directions expect confused, criss-crossed zones \u2014 unpredictable sets.\n\nSunday, 2025-10-05 \u2014 peak / raw\n- Swell: This looks like the peak day for the NW/NNW mix. The 15.7 ft H NW component and the 14.4 ft H NNW component combine for powerful, continuous groundswell. The ENE/E short-period energy remains present, keeping the surface textured and shortening wave faces between sets.\n- Conditions: Morning may offer the cleanest windows if trades remain light. If the ENE trades pick up >12 kt, expect widespread onshore texture and a choppy surface \u2014 the cross-seas will make lineup spacing uneven and break timing less predictable.\n- Timing: Peak through the day into evening. Night could remain large but typically dies slightly after the peak.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Pipeline: Peak day for heavy slabs. Expect very large, critical tubes \u2014 these are full commitment conditions. The break will close out quickly and shorebreak impact will be severe. Rescue teams on alert. Not for novices.\n  - Sunset Beach: Large, long-period walls, fast sections and heavy runouts. Expect spectacular rides when the sets organize; also heavy, dangerous wipeouts. Best windows when tide is mid to high.\n  - Waimea Bay: Potential for giant sets; big-wave protocol likely in effect. Tow and experienced big-wave teams only at the absolute peak. Mid tide into rising tide gives fastest run-ins; low tide exposes shallow reef \u2014 big hazard.\n  - Intermediate breaks (e.g., Haleiwa): Expect long ramps and powerful sections \u2014 best for strong, experienced surfers. Some rip-dominated conditions near passes.\n- Operational notes: Expect closures or advisories at the more exposed reefs if organizations monitor conditions. Lifeguards will be busy.\n\nMonday, 2025-10-06 \u2014 easing but still raw\n- Swell: The NW/NNW energy begins to drop, but multiple components and residual ENE/E windswell keep surf above average. Peaks may still run large in the morning; expect a measurable decrease through the day.\n- Conditions: If trades remain light to moderate, the afternoon may become cleaner as shorter-period energy fades. If east trades hold, expect continued textured surface, especially on points and beach breaks.\n- Timing: Decreasing through the day; long-period sets will space out more and the smaller windswell will be less dominant by evening.\n- Break-specific:\n  - Pipeline: Still big in the morning and for big sets, but fewer massive bombs as the NW energy drops. Expect a cleaner mid/late day window if winds back off.\n  - Sunset Beach: Long walls early, easing into more manageable size later. Best runs likely in the morning to mid-day.\n  - Waimea Bay: Dropping \u2014 still big but not as sustained as peak day. Watch for leftover sets; surf will remain hazardous for all but experienced big-wave teams.\n  - Smaller north-facing points: Easing to large-plus and more ridable lines for experienced surfers.\n\nSwell direction & period analysis (technical)\n- Directional mix: Primary energy from NW (dominant) with NNW wrap and secondary ENE/E short-period energy. The NW/NNW arrivals will refract and wrap into the northwest-facing reef systems (Pipeline \u2192 Sunset \u2192 Waimea) and create large, steep faces. The ENE/E component is good at shallow, east-exposed beaches and will shorten faces and create closeouts in between long-period sets.\n- Period assumption effect: If the NW components are longer-period (14\u201318s) the reefs will see powerful, widely spaced sets with high energy and long run-ups \u2014 big, hollow barrels at Pipeline and long walls at Sunset. If periods are shorter (<12s), expect punchier, faster-breaking waves that close out more. Because periods weren\u2019t provided, treat the scenario as worst-case (long-period energy) for safety planning.\n- Cross-seas: Mixed directions create confused, lumpy lines and unpredictable set arrivals. Expect cross-whipping wind chop where ENE/E windswell overlaps the NW groundswells.\n\nWind and weather effects (North Shore specifics)\n- East to ENE trades (common in fall) will produce variable effects:\n  - Light ENE (5\u201310 kt): can be near-offshore at many north-facing reefs in the morning \u2014 cleaner faces.\n  - Moderate ENE (12\u201318 kt): creates onshore texture and shortens the face \u2014 surf goes lumpier and wind chop increases.\n  - Stronger northwesterlies (>15 kt): would steepen faces and add wind chop to the already large sets.\n- Local micro-effects: Points like Haleiwa and Rocky Point will feel different than the central Ehukai-Pipeline complex. Topography and headland shelter will alter wind at each break \u2014 check local cams early AM.\n- Weather: Unknown from supplied data. Any low-level frontal passage or local squall can rapidly alter wind direction/intensity and swell period.\n\nTide and run-up considerations (general)\n- Pipeline/Off The Wall: Best mid to lower-mid tides for the classic slabs, but timing is critical \u2014 too low and reefs expose, too high and bowls choke.\n- Sunset: Performs across a range of tides; mid to high often yields the best ramping walls.\n- Waimea: Prefers mid to rising tide for big compressions on run-ins; extreme low tide increases reef hazard.\n- Small/point breaks: Low tides can accelerate steeper takes; high tide may mellow some peaks.\n\nComparison to recent and seasonal norms\n- Recent: If the North Shore has been in a quieter, early-fall mode (typical 2\u20136 ft H), this pulse is a clear step up \u2014 larger than recent early-fall days. Multiple overlapping components add the rawness that normally arrives later in fall/early winter.\n- Seasonal/normal (typical fall): Fall on the North Shore is a transition to NW-dominant swells. Your provided heights (multiple components in double-digit Hawaiian scale) are on the high side for early fall and are closer to early winter surf levels. Expect a shift from the smaller, intermittent NW arrivals of early fall toward a more consistent NW groundswell pattern as winter approaches.\n\nPractical advice and safety\n- Check updated buoy periods and local cams before paddling \u2014 the period assumptions matter a lot for hazard and surf quality.\n- If you\u2019re not experienced on hollow north reefs: pick a protected break or sit this out. Strong rips, backwash, and shore impact are significant hazards.\n- For big-wave teams: confirm tow/rescue presence at Waimea and coordinated safety plans at Pipeline/Sunset.\n- For spectators: expect dramatic visuals and potential closures; keep clear of shorebreak zones.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Re-run this forecast using actual buoy periods and a corrected wind read (please supply buoy IDs or the correct wind vector), or\n- Produce a shorter \u201csurf plan\u201d with best launch windows, exact tide targets and safest entry points for a chosen break.\n\nWould you like me to update this with real-time buoy periods and a corrected wind observation?",
  "south_shore": "Overview (Oct 4 \u2013 Oct 6, 2025)\n- Quick take: Data provided has gaps (no swell periods; wind given as 60\u00b0 at 0 kts). Working from the provided swell magnitudes and direction vectoring plus typical South Shore seasonal behavior, there are two southerly components present \u2014 SSE and SSW \u2014 that will be the drivers. If the listed numbers (SSE 5.9 ft Hawaiian, SSW 5.2 ft Hawaiian) are accurate, this is a well-above-normal southerly pulse for early October and will produce very large, powerful South Shore surf at exposed reefs and points. If those magnitudes are actually erroneous (common when periods/sources are missing), conditions may be closer to the normal Fall range (1\u20133 ft Hawaiian). I\u2019ll give a main forecast assuming the numbers are correct, note the uncertainties, and provide practical, break-specific guidance.\n\nKey assumptions and conversions\n- Hawaiian scale to face height: face \u2248 2 \u00d7 Hawaiian. So:\n  - SSE 5.9 ft (Haw) \u2192 faces ~ 11.8 ft\n  - SSW 5.2 ft (Haw) \u2192 faces ~ 10.4 ft\n- Periods were not supplied (0.0 s). Period matters: long-period (12\u201316 s) southern hemisphere groundswells will be far punchier and more powerful on reefs/points than short-period (<10 s) local wind swells. I\u2019ll present two period scenarios where it changes the surf character.\n- Wind listed as 60\u00b0 at 0 kts: interpret as light/variable with a preferred trade direction from the ENE (roughly 060\u00b0). Calm/very light winds are favorable for clean morning conditions on the South Shore; expect typical afternoon seabreezes to fill in from the E\u2013NE in absence of synoptic pressure gradients.\n\nSwell analysis (direction, size, period scenarios)\n- Direction: SSE (S 157\u00b0) and SSW (S 200\u2013210\u00b0). Both are within the South Shore window (S to SSW is prime for this season). The two components are close enough that many south-facing reefs and points will feel combined energy; certain orientations will favor one component over the other (more easterly facing reefs favor SSE, more westerly-facing points favor SSW).\n- Magnitude: Listed as 5.9 ft and 5.2 ft Hawaiian. If correct, that is a large southerly pulse for early October \u2014 well above the Fall norm (see comparison below).\n- Period scenarios (periods not supplied; choose likely ranges):\n  - Long-period case (12\u201316 s): energy is organized, deep-water groupiness will translate efficiently onto shelf and reef contours. Expect strong, clean faces, long walls, heavy lips on reef breaks, and favorable setup for outer reefs/points to hold very large, rideable faces. Hold and punchy takeoffs at Bowls-type breaks (Ala Moana Bowls, some Waikiki outer reefs).\n  - Short-period case (6\u201310 s): more wind-swell character. Surf will be steeper, punchier, less organized. Beachbreaks and inner reef spots will see big push but shorter rides and more dumping. Power is more surface-level; less danger of extreme sets at deep-water refracting reefs, but still heavy.\n\nTiming (building / peaking / dropping)\n- Oct 4 (Sat): Expect swell energy to be present and building in the first half of the day. Morning will be cleaner (light winds). If these swells are long-period groundswell, the bulk of energy will push in and the South Shore will be on the upswing through the day.\n- Oct 5 (Sun): Peak day for the pulse \u2014 either the highest tide of energy or close to it. If two southerly components phase constructively at certain spots, expect the largest, most powerful conditions on this date.\n- Oct 6 (Mon): Gradual drop. Energy will still be elevated compared with seasonal norms into the morning, but by late Mon the swell should be trending down. The rate of drop depends on storm fetch persistence; without long-period sustain (i.e., if these are short-period local swells), the decrease will be quicker.\n\nWind & weather effects (South Shore specifics)\n- Morning: calm to light winds. With the listed 0 kts, mornings should be clean and glassy \u2014 best window for all levels.\n- Afternoon: typical Fall behavior brings seabreezes from the E\u2013ENE (060\u2013090\u00b0). On the South Shore, that often creates onshore to cross-onshore wind at many spots by mid/late morning into afternoon, increasing chop and blowing out the most exposed peaks.\n- Local shading: Waikiki\u2019s inner reefs can be protected from small ENE breezes early, but sustained afternoon trades will push chop into the lineup.\n- Weather uncertainty: no synoptic info provided; if a surface low rides near the islands it can flip winds and increase local wind swell; monitor updates.\n\nBreak-by-break detail (town spots / notable South Shore breaks)\nNote: \u201cHawaiian scale\u201d sizes below; face conversions in parentheses. Use conservative interpretations for each break based on long- vs short-period scenarios.\n\nWaikiki complex (Canoes, Queens, Pops, etc.)\n- If long-period swell: Outer reefs (Pops, Queens) will see long, powerful open-face walls \u2014 faces in the 10\u201312 ft range on the outer sets (5\u20136 ft Haw). Canoes (the long rolling peak) will have very long rides on the bigger sets but expect heavy takeoffs and tricky entrances. Crowds will be selective \u2014 mostly advanced riders on the largest sets.\n- If short-period swell: Waikiki will get punchy, fast waves; inner reefs and the shoreline will see more closeouts. Canoes may still run but with shorter, quicker walls.\n\nAla Moana Bowls / Magic Island\n- Long-period: Ala Moana Bowls could be raw \u2014 heavy reef bowls with big lips and long faces (expect hollow, reefy sections). The channel will increase current and funneling; bigger water volumes through the bowl can make it dangerous. Advanced-only; expect long hold/critical sections.\n- Short-period: Bowls will be less organized but still heavy \u2014 expect quicker, punchier barrels that close out on the inside.\n\nKewalo Basin / Kaka\u02bbako shorebreaks\n- Exposed to southerly energy but also influenced by local bathymetry. Long-period swell will create big, powerful beachbreak sets that can jack up quickly and close out. Short-period swell: steep dumpy sets. Watch for strong shorebreak and powerful shoreward current.\n\nSans Souci / eastward-facing pocket reefs\n- Less directly in the SSW axis and may pick up more of the SSE component. Expect powerful but slightly less size than the most exposed points. In a long-period case, expect firm, rideable walls; in the short-period case, expect punchy, fast sections.\n\nGeneral surf character and hazards\n- If the swells are truly 5\u20136 ft Hawaiian: This is a large, powerful event \u2014 reef breaks will be very big, currents will be strong, and hold-down risk is significant. Spot-dependent: outer reefs and points will steepen and produce critical sections; inside sandbars and channels will be rippier.\n- Crowds: Selective lineup \u2014 experienced localism and strong surfer skill required on the largest sets.\n- Safety: Watch channels, rip currents, and the increased volume of water funneling through cuts around Magic Island and Ala Moana. Leashes, local knowledge, and respect for conditions are essential.\n- Beginner/intermediate guidance: Avoid exposed reefs and points above ~3 ft Hawaiian. If uncertain about actual swell magnitude, opt for protected inner reefs or smaller breaks in the morning when winds are light.\n\nComparison to recent and normal Fall conditions\n- Normal Fall pattern (early October): South to SSW groundswells typically 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian with fading frequency as the southern-hemisphere season wanes. Mornings are usually clean with trades building in the afternoon.\n- Comparison: If the supplied 5\u20136 ft Hawaiian numbers are accurate, this event is well above normal for this time of year \u2014 roughly 2\u20134\u00d7 the typical energy levels. That would be an unusually large late-summer/early-fall southerly pulse.\n- If the supplied magnitudes are an over-read or missing period information indicates short, local wind swell, conditions may be only modestly above-normal or right in the typical Fall 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian range.\n\nPractical recommendations (by skill level)\n- Advanced/Pro: Expect powerful, hollow, long-period walls on reefs and points in the morning. Choose break based on preferred style (long-wall Waikiki outer reefs vs. heavy bowls at Ala Moana). Be mindful of set intervals and increased current near channels.\n- Intermediate: Stick to more protected sections, surf morning glass, and avoid the outside sets at big reef breaks. Use longer boards for paddling and positioning on the longer-period option.\n- Beginner: Sit this one out if the swell is near the listed magnitudes. If uncertain and actual surf is small (1\u20133 ft Haw), choose shallow, protected beach breaks in the morning with supervision.\n\nBottom line / actionable summary\n- Primary driver: Two southerly components (SSE and SSW). Provided magnitudes indicate a strong pulse \u2014 much larger than normal for early Oct \u2014 but periods were not supplied. Period will determine whether this is punchy/closer to wind-swell character (short period) or an organized groundswells (long period) that will punish exposed reefs and create long, powerful faces.\n- Best window: Mornings each day (Oct 4\u20136) while winds are light; afternoons trend windier and choppier with typical seabreeze filling in.\n- Expect the swell to build Oct 4, probably peak Oct 5, and ease Oct 6 \u2014 monitor updated buoy and model period data to refine the forecast and safety decisions.\n- If you\u2019re heading out, get updated period readings from the NN or local buoy and heed local lifeguards \u2014 these numbers imply a very powerful South Shore if they\u2019re correct.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Re-run this with assumed period values (e.g., 10 s, 14 s) and give exact expected face heights at individual spots, or\n- Pull the latest buoy and model output to replace the missing period and wind-speed data and produce a tightened, time-of-day surf table for each break.",
  "daily": "Short note: I don\u2019t have live data for 2025-10-04. Below is a practical, surfer-focused forecast scenario for Oahu assuming a NW swell hits that day. Treat this as guidance \u2014 check Surfline/NOAA buoys, local cams and tide charts before heading out.\n\n1) Snapshot (today, NW swell scenario)\n- Morning: likely the cleanest \u2014 light winds, glassy windows before trades build.\n- Midday \u2192 afternoon: trades usually pick up, making conditions bumpier on exposed breaks.\n- Overall: NW swell will favor North and West exposures; South and East shores will be much smaller/protected.\n\n2) Wave heights (Hawaiian scale) \u2014 expected ranges\n(Note: Hawaiian scale roughly reports about half the face height. Face height \u2248 Hawaiian \u00d7 2.)\n- North Shore (Ehukai/Sunset/Waimea zone): 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian (faces ~6\u201312 ft) \u2014 size depends on swell energy; bigger sets toward Sunset/Waimea if the swell is strong.\n- West Shore (Makaha, Nanakuli, Ka'ena point): 3\u20137 ft Hawaiian (faces ~6\u201314 ft) \u2014 West gets very direct NW energy; expect hollow peaks on exposed points.\n- South Shore (Waikiki/Ala Moana): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (faces ~2\u20134 ft) \u2014 generally small, broken wind swell only.\n- East Shore (Sandy's/Pupukea east-facing coves): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (faces ~2\u20134 ft) \u2014 little direct energy from NW swell.\n\n3) Wind & weather (likely pattern)\n- Morning: light variable winds (best window for offshore/clean lines).\n- Late morning \u2192 afternoon: trades 10\u201320+ kt from NE\u2013E are common in October \u2014 cross-onshore for NW/West exposures (choppy for west in afternoon).\n- Typical temps: mid-to-upper 70s\u201380\u00b0F ocean; possible scattered showers with NE trades.\n- Action: aim for the early-morning glassy window; avoid late-afternoon on exposed west breaks if trades strengthen.\n\n4) Tides (general, surf-relevant guidance)\n- Many reef breaks on North/West perform best on mid \u2192 high tides (cleaner takeoffs, less exposed reef).\n- Low tides increase shallow reef hazards and can make waves break too fast/close out at some spots.\n- Action: consult the local tide chart for 2025-10-04. Plan sessions around mid-tide/high-tide windows for exposed reef points; at exposed shallow breaks, avoid lowest tides.\n\n5) Best spots today (based on NW swell and skill level)\n- For advanced/expert (big, hollow NW energy): Sunset Beach, Ehukai (Banzai/Pipeline only if big and in-shape), Waimea (if the swell is large), Makaha for powerful west-facing peaks.\n- Intermediate: West-facing points on milder parts of the west shore (smaller sets at Nanakuli), some protected reefs on the northwest that hold shape on moderate size.\n- Beginner / mellow session: Waikiki/Ala Moana or south-facing protected coves \u2014 much smaller and safer when NW swell is up.\n- Local note: if swell is big, many north reefs will be crowded with big-wave surfers; pick your spot based on skill & local conditions.\n\n6) Changing conditions through the day (what to watch)\n- Early morning: best window \u2014 cleaner, lighter winds, less crowd.\n- Late morning/afternoon: trades tend to increase, creating cross/on-shore wind and chop on exposed NW/West breaks.\n- Swell evolution: NW swells can pulse \u2014 check buoy reports: heights can increase with incoming sets or drop if the storm energy fades. Watch for occasional larger sets (sneaker sets) and rapid shorebreak/reefall changes.\n- Safety: currents and rips intensify with larger sets; monitor changing lines and talk to locals/guards if unsure.\n\nQuick checklist before you go\n- Check live swell height/period and buoy reports (NDBC, Surfline).\n- Verify exact tide times for your chosen spot.\n- Confirm wind forecast (morning vs afternoon).\n- Bring appropriate gear: reef booties for shallow reefs, leash, helmet for big/rocky breaks if applicable.\n- If unsure of conditions, pick a protected south-facing spot or consult lifeguards.\n\nIf you want, I can produce a tighter \u201cif the swell is X ft at buoy Y\u201d style forecast \u2014 tell me the NW swell size/period or share a buoy reading and I\u2019ll convert into Hawaiian scale and recommend exact spots/tide windows.",
