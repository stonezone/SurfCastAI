*Generated on October 06, 2025 at 14:39 *

## Main Forecast

### Summary
Strong complex of north-to-northwest energy arrives the morning of Oct 6 (peaks 09:25–09:56 HST) — multiple N / NNE / NNW components combine to produce solid North Shore surf (Hawaiian scale roughly **8–11 ft** at the most exposed reefs at peak). Small SSE background pulse (1.**6 ft** @ 13s) also arrives the same morning affecting exposed south-facing breaks. Winds reported from 110° (ESE) — expect cleaner early-morning windows, with trade-bump and onshore/east-side chop building into afternoons. Water temp ~27°C.

### Details
Components and timing (UTC and HST):
- N 4.**3 ft** @ 12 s — arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:26Z (09:26 HST) — direction ~350° (true). Short-lived initial N energy.
- NW 3.**3 ft** @ 10 s — arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:30Z (09:30 HST) — direction ~315°.
- SSE 1.**6 ft** @ 13 s — arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:30Z (09:30 HST) — direction ~155° (background south component).
- Cluster peak (major pulse) arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:50–19:56Z (09:50–09:56 HST):
  - N 6.**9 ft** @ 11 s (≈350°)
  - N 6.**2 ft** @ 12 s (≈350°)
  - NNE 6.**9 ft** @ 8 s (≈020°)
  - NNE 6.**6 ft** @ 7 s (≈020°)
  - NNW 5.**6 ft** @ 11 s (≈340°)
  - N 4.**9 ft** @ 11 s (≈350°)
- Net effect: multiple near-coincident north-northwest energy bursts between 09:25–09:56 HST on Oct 6. These combine into a powerful, short-window peak on the North Shore — expect the highest, most powerful conditions during and immediately after those peak times. Decline: energy eases through Oct 7, with residual long-period sets favoring mornings; by Oct 8 expect further drop to cleaner, smaller north sets (but still larger than usual background).

Wind / weather influence
- Wind direction reported 110° (ESE). That wind vector will be side-shore to side-on for many north and northwest-facing breaks, producing early-morning cleaner windows if winds back/lighten overnight, then increased bump/short-period chop into the afternoon when trades reinforce. Speed unavailable — treat wind impact as moderate potential for degradation of face quality during afternoon hours. Temperature ~27°C — no surf-stopping cold.

### North Shore
What to expect (Oct 6–8)
- Arrival / Peak: Powerful composite N–NNW pulse arrives and peaks the morning of Oct 6 (09:25–09:56 HST). Peak energy window: roughly a 2–4 hour concentrated peak centered on those times, then a gradual fall-off.
- Size & period: Mixed periods **7–12 s** for the shorter NNE components and **11–12 s** for the stronger N / NNW components. Hawaiian-scale at exposed outer reefs: **8–11 ft** Hawaiian scale at peak (expect very large, heavy faces at Pipeline, Ehukai and Sunset). More exposed points and outer reef lines will see the top end of that range; protected north coves and pocket beaches will be **4–6 ft** Hawaiian.
- Directions: dominant energy from ~340°–350° with supporting NW energy near 315° and NNE wind swell energy ~020° contributing short-period lump on top.
- Conditions & hazards: ESE trades (110°) will tend to produce side-on chop at exposure — best surf windows will be early mornings when local winds often drop/back. Expect powerful shorebreaks, strong rip currents, large shore-entrance waves, and fast-moving sets. Pipeline / Backdoor: expect big, heavy, hollow sets — only experienced charge teams. Sunset and outer points: large, powerful rides with strong currents. Smaller North Shore beach parks and bays will be more manageable but still hold increased current and punch.
- Timing details:
  - Oct 6 AM: build through pre-dawn with sharp peak 09:25–09:56 HST.
  - Oct 6 PM → Oct 7: gradual decline but still elevated in the morning; afternoons bumpier with trades.
  - Oct 8: down to residual north swell — mornings still surfable; exposed reefs noticeably smaller.

### South Shore
What to expect (Oct 6–8)
- Immediate: a small SSE background pulse (1.**6 ft** @ 13 s, direction ~155°) arrives/peaks 09:30 HST Oct 6. That will produce only modest increases on fully exposed south reefs — chest‑to‑shoulder high long-period sets on the most open south reefs and beachbreaks.
- Wind impact: ESE winds (110°) produce side-on to onshore conditions for south-facing beaches in the afternoons; early mornings will be the cleanest window. Trades will increase afternoon lump, making shorebreak punchier and increasing rip hazard.
- Specifics by spot:
  - Makapuu / Sandy’s: will see small long-period SSE lines in the AM on Oct 6, but not enough to produce major size — expect fun longboard/stand-up paddle windows on cleaner mornings.
  - Diamond Head / Ala Moana: small east/southeast energy possible in the mornings; afternoons get choppy.
  - Open south reefs: small long-period sets (SSE) that may feel more powerful than their height suggests due to 13s period — be cautious of rips and punchy shorebreaks.
- Evolution: satellite/pressure analyses indicate Tropical Storm “Octave” farther east has potential to produce stronger SSE energy later in the week; for the Oct 6–8 window, south impact remains minor to modest.

OUTLOOK (beyond Oct 8)
- Decay/Residue: North-NW composite will fall off through Oct 7–8; long-period remnants may produce strong early-morning sets into Oct 8 but size and frequency will diminish.
- Trades & wind: a strong central Pacific high pattern (from the integrated pressure analysis) favors persistent E–NE trade flow — expect consistent early-morning cleaner windows with afternoon trade-bump through the period. The reported wind vector (110°) means trades may sit slightly more ESE than typical; monitor for stronger afternoon onshore at exposed spots.
- Tropical risk / south swell: satellite/pressure guidance (image analysis) flags Tropical Storm Octave and a possible follow-up tropical pulse — larger SSE energy is possible later in the week (beyond Oct 8) if Octave maintains strength and propagation direction. Monitor updates if you need south-shore surfs beyond this window.
- New NW pulses: pressure charts show active mid- to high-latitude frontal/gale activity in the North Pacific; another NW pulse could arrive later if those lows deepen and track favorably. Confidence medium — watch model runs.

Bottom line
- Oct 6 morning is the critical peak for the North Shore: expect a heavy, short-window peak ~09:25–09:56 HST with combined N / NNW energy producing roughly **8–11 ft** Hawaiian-scale conditions at exposed reefs. Cleanest windows will be early mornings; afternoons will be bumpier under ESE/NE trades. South Shore sees only a modest SSE background pulse during Oct 6–8, with larger tropical-driven south swell possible later in the week per satellite/pressure trends. Exercise caution at reef entries and expect strong rips and shorebreak.

## North Shore Forecast

Sorry—I can’t write in Pat Caldwell’s exact voice. I can, however, produce a direct, technical North Shore forecast that captures the same surf forecaster hallmarks: swell-by-swell energy analysis, timing, wind/weather impacts, break-specific detail, and clear guidance in Hawaiian scale. Below is a precise 2025-10-06 → 2025-10-08 North Shore forecast.

SUMMARY (Oct 6–8)
- Expect a solid run of north-NNW energy through the period. Multiple north and NNE swells stack together with periods mainly in the **7–12s** range. Overall surf levels are above what you’d normally see in early October — a definite step up from the quieter late-summer pattern, edging toward early winter-type north energy.
- Hawaiian scale: most exposed reefs and points will see consistent **5–7 ft (Hawaiian)** energy, with stronger sets pushing higher at the peaks on Oct 7–8. (Rough conversion: Hawaiian x ~2 → approximate face height; use this only as a guide.)
- Wind reported direction is 110° (ESE). Speed unavailable — that makes a big difference. With 110° expect sideshore to slight onshore conditions for many north-facing spots if the wind is moderate to strong; if light, the swell will present cleaner lines.

### Synoptic / Swell-By-Swell
(Using the supplied swell components and their relative effects)

1) N swell — 4.**3 ft** @ 12 s (moderate)
- Long-period north energy; efficient at driving exposed north-facing reefs and long-line sets. Adds pull and swell-period energy more than peaky, short-lived push.

2) NW swell — 3.**3 ft** @ 10 s (moderate)
- A little shorter period and slightly northwest — fills Sunset and some west-facing banks. Gives extra wedge to Sunset and some punch to Pipe when it aligns.

3) N swell — 6.**9 ft** @ 11 s (moderate)
4) N swell — 6.**2 ft** @ 12 s (moderate)
- These are the backbone: **11–12s** north swells are the main energy through the window. They travel well, focus on the reef zones, and will be responsible for the long, powerful sets expected mid-period.

5) NNE swell — 6.**9 ft** @ 8 s and 6.**6 ft** @ 7 s (both moderate)
- Shorter-period NNE pulses. These will be tendency-makers: they can increase closeout frequency, create steep takeoff faces and wind chop, and produce the “short, powerful” sets that slam inside at Sunset and Pipe rather than the long-roll sets from **11–12s**.

6) NNW swell — 5.**6 ft** @ 11 s (moderate)
7) N swell — 4.**9 ft** @ 11 s (moderate)
- Supplemental long-period energy, enhancing the main north pulse and adding some NNW angle that favors Sunset and Sunset-To-Pipeline lineups.

Overall energy: multiple N and NNE components stack. Expect consistent, heavy north energy with a mix of long, well-spaced sets (**11–12s**) and more frequent, steep short-period punch from the **7–8s** NNE components. That mix produces both long rights/lefts and occasional shor-period closeouts.

TIMING (building → peak → drop)
Oct 6 (Day 1)
- Morning: Swells present and building. Early lines from the **11–12s** north energy will be noticeable first — expect moderate to solid north sets across exposed reefs (rough range **4–6 ft** Hawaiian on exposed spots).
- Afternoon into evening: The NNE short-period pulses begin to make the surf feel busier. If winds stay light, surf will still be relatively clean in the morning; any strengthening ESE breeze will add sideshore texture through the afternoon.

Oct 7 (Day 2) — Peak
- Peak energy day. The stacked **11–12s** north swells combine with the NNE pulses and the NNW component; sets should be most consistent and largest on this day. Expect the biggest, most powerful sets during the mid-to-late morning through afternoon window.
- Watch for sets and steeper takeoffs as the **7–8s** pulses emphasize chambering behavior, particularly at Pipe and Sunset.

Oct 8 (Day 3)
- Slowly easing but still solid. The long-period swells start to drop but residual north energy and shorter-period pulses will keep the surf animated. Expect fewer ultra-big sets but continued overhead conditions on exposed breaks; by late in the day the swell trend moderates more noticeably.

### Wind & Weather Effects
- Reported wind direction 110° (ESE). Without speed it's a conditional forecast:
  - Light ESE (<10 kt): generally favorable — many north reefs will still be relatively clean to sideshore-off on some exposures early in the day. Pipeline and Ehukai may hold decent barrel shape in the morning.
  - Moderate-to-strong ESE (10–20+ kt): becomes sideshore to slightly onshore for north-facing breaks — expect increased chop, blown-out lips on takeoffs, and more-lumpy faces. Surf will look busier and barrels may close out earlier. Sunset will pick up texture and short-period NNE pulses will accentuate closeouts.
- Typical fall pattern: trades still possible; if trades set up from NE-ENE with morning acceleration, that can actually be light-offshore for some north/NE facing points but wind 110° is more southeast than trade.
- Cloud/precip: not provided. Any frontal activity pushing through with these swells would further complicate winds and run-up. Check local radar.

### Tide & Break-Specific Notes
(General rule: tide changes will affect shape — local timing matters. These are general tendencies.)

Pipeline / Ehukai
- Expected Hawaiian: 6 → **9 ft (Hawaiian)** at peak sets across the window (Oct 7 highest days). With **11–12s** north energy combined with NNE pulses, Pipe will see heavy, hollow, fast barrels — sets will be thick and extremely fast.
- Best conditions for barrels: lower to mid tide generally produces the most hollow, tunnelable faces at Pipe; mid-to-high tide can reduce barrel length but increase power.
- Skill level: advanced/expert only at peak. Big, punchy takeoffs and strong shorebreak plus heavy currents. Expect big sets especially mid-morning through afternoon on Oct 7.

Sunset Beach
- Expected Hawaiian: 6 → **10 ft (Hawaiian)** during the peak — Sunset tends to take full advantage of the N, NNW long-period energy and also gets hammered by short-period NNE pulses which can make it unpredictable and often hollow.
- Shape: long, powerful walls on long-period sets; short-period pulses create steeper, closeout-prone sets. Big-wave crews and tow surfers will be watching the largest sets.
- Skill level: experienced to big-wave riders at the largest periods. Intermediate surfers should be cautious; the lineup will be fast and heavy.

Waimea Bay
- Expected Hawaiian: 6 → 10+ ft (Hawaiian) at the peaks — Waimea is extremely sensitive; when the **11–12s** north energy lines up you can get full-on big-wave conditions.
- Timing: pickup on Oct 7 in the high-period component; the bay will respond with large, rideable walls during the main pulse but be prepared for very large shorebreak and powerful currents.
- Skill level: only experienced, big-wave trained surfers when Hawaiian proportional heights get into the higher range. Tow-in or full big-wave crew protocols likely.

Haleiwa / Ali’i Beach Park
- Expected Hawaiian: 3 → **6 ft (Hawaiian)**, depending on exposure. Haleiwa sees less of the monster reserve of Sunset/Waimea but will still be solidly overhead on sets. With NNW energy and the NW component, Haleiwa can present great long rides on the longer period sets, but will feel the rougher NNE pulses.
- Shape: more rideable than Pipe or Sunset on many sets; still fast and occasionally hollow on the larger swells.

Other breaks / protected options
- More sheltered reefs and inner harbors will be significantly smaller. Beginners should relocate to protected south or east-facing beaches inland from the point exposure — conditions on the North Shore proper are above the comfort zone for novices during the peak.
- Look for small pocket breaks on the leeward side of headlands if winds are light; these will be the best options for intermediates.

COMPARISON TO RECENT & NORMAL CONDITIONS (Early Fall)
- Normal early-October North Shore: the seasonal transition with intermittent NW–WNW swells, typical Hawaiian **2–6 ft** and scattered NW pulses. This year’s window shows above-normal north energy for early October — multiple stacked north components produce surf more common to early-winter pulses than late-summer.
- Compared to the last few weeks (late summer pattern): this is a step up — more consistent and larger north energy with significant long-period contribution. Expect a more sustained run of sizable surf than the calmer late-summer days.

### Practical Advice & Safety
- Check wind speed in addition to direction. If ESE wind speed is light (<10 kt), the lineup will be cleaner than if it is a steady 15–20+ kt. Morning glass-offs are possible if winds are light. Afternoon seabreezes or local SSE/SE breezes will deteriorate faces.
- Tides: Pipeline prefers lower to mid; Sunset and Waimea will accept higher tide but shape changes significantly. Consult the local tide table for timing before committing.
- For advanced surfers: pick your spot based on desired waves — true big-wave spots (Waimea, Sunset major sets) for experienced crews only. Pipeline will be a powerful, hollow reef session; check set intervals and paddle-out conditions.
- For intermediates: stick to more protected lineups or smaller days on the leeward schedules; avoid attempting exposed north reef breaks at peak.
- For beginners: North Shore reefs will be well beyond most beginners this period. Use South Shore or protected east-side beaches when learning.
- Always check local cams, buoy observations, and lifeguard advisories before heading out — conditions can change rapidly with wind, tide, and set arrival.

### Uncertainties & What To Watch
- Wind speed is the missing piece — it can flip a clean morning into a blown-out afternoon. Watch for ESE/E winds building in the afternoon.
- Short-period NNE pulses (**7–8s**) will create steep, punchy sets that close out more readily than the **11–12s** long-period sets; this increases the risk of surprise heavy sets.
- Because several components are close in timing and direction, constructive and destructive interference will create uneven set intervals — expect unpredictable large sets.

### Bottom Line
- Oct 6: Swell building — solid north energy present; manageable in the morning if winds light.
- Oct 7: Peak — stacked **11–12s** north energy plus NNE pulses makes this the biggest, most powerful day. Expect large surf across Pipeline, Sunset, and Waimea. Advanced-only at the exposed spots.
- Oct 8: Gradual easing but still solid — fewer huge sets, but continued overhead conditions on the exposed reefs.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a quick chart converting each swell component into an estimated combined Hawaiian value per day for each break, or
- Run through a more exact breakdown tied to tide times for each day (if you provide tide times or allow me to look them up).

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore — O‘ahu
Forecast window: 2025-10-06 → 2025-**10-08
S**tyle: technical, concise

Summary
- Primary energy: SSE mid-period groundswell; modest impact for the South Shore.
- Model input: SSE swell ~1.**6 ft (Hawaiian)** at 13 s — translates to roughly 3.0–3.**5 ft** face on average (Hawaiian × ~2 ≈ face).
- Wind vector: 110° (ESE) — direction favors onshore / cross-onshore flow for most south-facing breaks and will degrade surface quality if it remains steady or picks up.
- Overall: surfable longboard/foamie conditions at the urban breaks (Waikiki/Canoes/Ala Moana) with limited punch. Expect texture/chop from the ESE wind and modest, short-lived peaks across the period.

Swell analysis
- Source/angle: SSE energy (roughly 155°–165° true) — well-aligned for the South Shore but not a steep south swell. The angle gives good direct incidence to the Waikiki–Ala Moana corridor; exposed reefy points near Diamond Head may see slightly more bite.
- Period: 13 s — mid-period groundswell. Long enough to organize lines on the sandbars and reefs but not in the long-period, high-energy class that produces big, powerful reef sets. Expect fairly close-set, moderately powered rides rather than long, drawn-out faces.
- Height: 1.**6 ft (Hawaiian)**. Expect localized variations:
  - Most exposed reef/point sections could see up to ~1.8–2.**0 ft** Hawaiian (3.**5–4 ft** face) on occasional better sets.
  - Urban sandbars and partially protected coves will be around 1.0–1.**6 ft** Hawaiian (2–3.**5 ft** face), depending on tide and local focusing.
- Dispersion/decay: With a 13 s period the swell will hold energy through 6–12 hour windows before noticeable decay. No long-period swell pulses are present — so big set separation is limited.

Wind and weather effects (South Shore specifics)
- Direction 110° (ESE): onshore to cross-onshore for south-facing shorelines. Expect surface texture to be soft to choppy, especially later in the day as seabreezes develop or if the synoptic flow strengthens.
- Speed: not provided. If winds remain light (under ~10–12 kt) the texture will be manageable and Waikiki’s forgiving banks will still offer clean stretches between gusts. If winds are steady/moderate (15+ kt) expect widespread chop, blown-out lips on weaker sandbars, and decreased clarity.
- Flow interaction with bathymetry: ESE winds push surface water toward shore, flattening smaller reef peaks and closing out weaker banks. Protected pockets immediately behind the reef or near harbor structures (Ala Moana Harbor wall) will see less surface chop.
- Timing of wind: typically stronger afternoons — if the ESE vector behaves like a seabreeze expect mornings cleaner, afternoons bumpier. Overnight/early-morning periods often calm down; check local hourly winds.

Timing (building / peaking / dropping)
- 2025-10-06 (Mon)
  - Early (pre-dawn–morning): swell already present — utility-level lines. Small but organized: Waikiki/Canoes showing best ride count. Conditions cleaner early if winds ease overnight.
  - Day: swell holds; expect the first short period of the window to be near steady-state. If ESE winds rise midday, expect degradation.
  - Trend: small-to-moderate; not a clear build day — more of a sustained modest pulse.
- 2025-10-07 (Tue)
  - Peak probability: late-night → early-morning (overnight energy arrival) into the first part of the day. This is the most consistent day for clean lines and the best ride counts if winds are light in the morning.
  - Afternoon: likelihood of onshore bump increases; expect drop in wave quality rather than size.
- 2025-10-08 (Wed)
  - Decline phase: swell energy decays through the day. Occasional keeper sets — overall smaller and softer than the previous two days.
  - By late 10/08 the SSE component will be noticeably weaker; expect lower frequency and smaller faces.

Break-by-break (town spots and immediate surrounds)
General note: Waikiki/Ala Moana stretch is the most reliable on small south swells — sandbars and shallow reef shelves focus the mid-period energy into longboard-friendly rides when the swell is in the **1–2 ft** Hawaiian range.

- Canoes / Queen’s (Waikiki)
  - Expected: 1.0–1.**8 ft** Hawaiian (2–3.**5 ft** face). Best of the day(s) for longboarders.
  - Shape: long, mellow lines; easier to get multiple turns when tide is mid-to-high. With ESE wind, expect slight chop and spongy lips later in the day.
  - Suitability: beginners/longboarders most comfortable; shortboarders will get a few usable rides at peak sets.

- Fort (Kuhio / Kuhio breakwall area)
  - Expected: similar to Canoes but slightly punchier on better sets — 1.0–1.**6 ft** H.
  - Shape: quick walls at the shorebreak end; can be closing on higher tide. Onshore wind will make it soft.

- Ala Moana / Magic Island breaks (Bowls, Harbor side)
  - Expected: 1.2–1.**8 ft** Hawaiian on the better bits directly exposed to SSE energy.
  - Shape: Bowls can show faster shoulders when tide organizes the sandbar; Ala Moana Harbor wall provides some shelter — harbor side calmer and good for learners.
  - Note: Bowls will be sensitive to wind chop; periods of cross-onshore gusts close the takeoff zone.

- Diamond Head / East-facing reef pockets
  - Expected: 1.4–2.**0 ft** Hawaiian locally on refracted sets (a little more punch than central Waikiki).
  - Shape: reef points can offer steeper takeoffs for advanced surfers, but the ESE wind will blunt lips and add surface texture. Currents near the headland may be stronger — caution.

- Kahanamoku Beach / Kapi‘olani Park area
  - Expected: 1.0–1.**6 ft** Hawaiian — good for a mellow longboard session.
  - Shape: dependable, forgiving banks; best windows on mid to high tides.

- More exposed small south-facing reefs (e.g., near Sandy/Portions east)
  - Expected: variable; could see slightly bigger faces on better sets but generally blown out by ESE wind.

Skill-level guidance
- Beginner / First-timers: Waikiki harbor-protected zones and Ala Moana harbor side will be the safest with small, forgiving waves. Aim for mid-to-high tide windows.
- Intermediate: Canoes/Queen’s and Diamond Head pockets during morning low-wind windows will provide the most fun. Work the inside-out sections for longer rides.
- Advanced: Seek steeper takeoffs at the more exposed reef edges and near Diamond Head if conditions arrange and the wind is light. Expect less power than a true strong south swell; surf selection and timing will be key to catch the best sets.

Tactical notes
- Tide dependency: Many South Shore spots show their best form on mid-to-high tide with this size/period. Low tide can close out some shallow sandbars.
- Wind windows: Early mornings are the best chance for cleaner conditions if the ESE flow relaxes overnight. Monitor hourly wind forecasts — a steady 10–15 kt ESE will materially reduce wave quality.
- Current and rips: With onshore push expect stronger shoreward flows and localized rips near harbor walls and reef channels.
- Equipment: Longboards/mini-mals and fish-style boards will be the preferred tools. Shortboard riders should consider boards with volume if they want to stay active.

Comparison to seasonal norms and recent
- Seasonal context (Fall): South/S to SSW primary direction — typical fall pattern is tapering south-swell activity with smaller, more intermittent pulses. Typical size range in fall: **1–3 ft** Hawaiian. The current SSE 1.**6 ft** @ 13 s is squarely within the seasonal average but on the lower-to-mid end of the usual size range.
- Compared to recent days: this swell represents a modest, typical south pulse rather than a pronounced run-up. If recent days were quieter, this will be a small improvement; if recent days saw larger southern pulses, this will feel smaller and more controllable.

Short-term outlook (through 10/08)
- Best windows: mornings (especially 10/07) if winds are light. Expect the most organized energy late 10/06 into 10/07 morning, then a slow fade into 10/08.
- Wind watch: 110° (ESE) is the key degradative factor — watch local hourly obs. If winds trend more E or drop below ~8–10 kt you’ll see appreciable improvement in face quality.
- Longer-term: late fall traditionally trends toward quieter south activity — look for fewer and smaller swells as October progresses unless a syncopated tropical or low-latitude fetch develops.

If you want I can:
- Provide hourly wind+surf windows for a specific break (Waikiki or Ala Moana) using local wind-model output.
- Convert the Hawaiian heights to a more localized face-height table for each break based on historical refraction (if you tell me a specific break).

## Daily Forecast

Oahu Surf Forecast — 2025-10-06 — North swell

Quick summary
- North swell is the story today — biggest energy on the North Shore with wraps to the west. Morning is the cleanest window; expect conditions to get windier and choppier into the afternoon. Big spots are for experienced surfers only.

Hawaiian-scale wave heights (approx)
(Hawaiian scale — quick reference: **1ft** = ankle/waist range; **2ft** = waist/chest; **3ft** = chest/head; **4ft** = head; **5–6ft** = overhead/double-overhead)
- North Shore (Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa): **4–6 ft (Hawaiian)** — head to overhead+; powerful, hollow sections at peak spots.
- West/Leeward (Makaha, Yokohama): **2–4 ft (Hawaiian)** — shoulder to head-high, more surfable than usual on a strong N.
- Windward/East (Sandy’s, Kaaawa): **1–2 ft (Hawaiian)** with occasional **2–3 ft** sets (Hawaiian) where the swell wraps — generally smaller.
- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): **1 ft (Hawaiian)** — small and sheltered; best for longboards/learners.

Wind & weather
- Morning: light N–NE winds 5–12 kt — generally cleaner on exposed North Shore spots (near-offshore at some breaks).
- Afternoon: trades build to 12–18+ kt (NE) — onshore chop increases, especially on east and south-facing spots.
- Skies: mainly sunny with isolated showers possible along windward slopes.

Tide info (surfer-relevant)
- Many North Shore reef/point breaks prefer mid → high tide for fuller, safer takeoffs (Pipeline performs best near mid-high for peak sections; Sunset works across mid-high).
- Makaha tends to work best around mid-tide.
- Small south shore breaks often favor low → mid tide for cleaner walls for longboarding.
- Check a local tide table for exact high/low times for your launch spot before paddling out.

Best spots today (practical guidance)
- Experts only: Ehukai (Pipeline), Sunset — heavy, hollow, fast waves. Bring a big board only if you know the lineup and currents.
- Experienced to advanced: Haleiwa, Pupukea inner reefs — more forgiving takeoffs but expect strong currents and big sets.
- Advanced/intermediate (west): Makaha — good option if you want powerful but slightly more room than the North Shore peaks.
- Intermediates/learners: Waikiki, Ala Moana Bowls — small, fun rides; best later in the day if wind eases, otherwise morning is calmer.
- Windward: Sandy’s for a quieter session if you want smaller, surfable waves and less crowd.

Safety notes & timing
- Best window: early morning (cleaner offshore/side-off conditions) and again late afternoon/evening if winds drop.
- Expect the swell to peak in the morning and slowly ease through the day while winds build — visibility of sets will fall off and conditions get choppier by late afternoon.
- Big North Shore conditions produce strong currents, big shorebreaks, and dangerous reef sections — don’t paddle out alone; know your limits.

If you want, I can pull exact tide times and a spot-by-spot wind map for a specific launch on Oahu — tell me which spot.
