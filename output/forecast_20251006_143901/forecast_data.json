  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nStrong complex of north-to-northwest energy arrives the morning of Oct 6 (peaks 09:25\u201309:56 HST) \u2014 multiple N / NNE / NNW components combine to produce solid North Shore surf (Hawaiian scale roughly 8\u201311 ft at the most exposed reefs at peak). Small SSE background pulse (1.6 ft @ 13s) also arrives the same morning affecting exposed south-facing breaks. Winds reported from 110\u00b0 (ESE) \u2014 expect cleaner early-morning windows, with trade-bump and onshore/east-side chop building into afternoons. Water temp ~27\u00b0C.\n\nDETAILS\nComponents and timing (UTC and HST):\n- N 4.3 ft @ 12 s \u2014 arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:26Z (09:26 HST) \u2014 direction ~350\u00b0 (true). Short-lived initial N energy.\n- NW 3.3 ft @ 10 s \u2014 arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:30Z (09:30 HST) \u2014 direction ~315\u00b0.\n- SSE 1.6 ft @ 13 s \u2014 arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:30Z (09:30 HST) \u2014 direction ~155\u00b0 (background south component).\n- Cluster peak (major pulse) arriving/peaking 2025-10-06T19:50\u201319:56Z (09:50\u201309:56 HST):\n  - N 6.9 ft @ 11 s (\u2248350\u00b0)\n  - N 6.2 ft @ 12 s (\u2248350\u00b0)\n  - NNE 6.9 ft @ 8 s (\u2248020\u00b0)\n  - NNE 6.6 ft @ 7 s (\u2248020\u00b0)\n  - NNW 5.6 ft @ 11 s (\u2248340\u00b0)\n  - N 4.9 ft @ 11 s (\u2248350\u00b0)\n- Net effect: multiple near-coincident north-northwest energy bursts between 09:25\u201309:56 HST on Oct 6. These combine into a powerful, short-window peak on the North Shore \u2014 expect the highest, most powerful conditions during and immediately after those peak times. Decline: energy eases through Oct 7, with residual long-period sets favoring mornings; by Oct 8 expect further drop to cleaner, smaller north sets (but still larger than usual background).\n\nWind / weather influence\n- Wind direction reported 110\u00b0 (ESE). That wind vector will be side-shore to side-on for many north and northwest-facing breaks, producing early-morning cleaner windows if winds back/lighten overnight, then increased bump/short-period chop into the afternoon when trades reinforce. Speed unavailable \u2014 treat wind impact as moderate potential for degradation of face quality during afternoon hours. Temperature ~27\u00b0C \u2014 no surf-stopping cold.\n\nNORTH SHORE\nWhat to expect (Oct 6\u20138)\n- Arrival / Peak: Powerful composite N\u2013NNW pulse arrives and peaks the morning of Oct 6 (09:25\u201309:56 HST). Peak energy window: roughly a 2\u20134 hour concentrated peak centered on those times, then a gradual fall-off.\n- Size & period: Mixed periods 7\u201312 s for the shorter NNE components and 11\u201312 s for the stronger N / NNW components. Hawaiian-scale at exposed outer reefs: 8\u201311 ft Hawaiian scale at peak (expect very large, heavy faces at Pipeline, Ehukai and Sunset). More exposed points and outer reef lines will see the top end of that range; protected north coves and pocket beaches will be 4\u20136 ft Hawaiian.\n- Directions: dominant energy from ~340\u00b0\u2013350\u00b0 with supporting NW energy near 315\u00b0 and NNE wind swell energy ~020\u00b0 contributing short-period lump on top.\n- Conditions & hazards: ESE trades (110\u00b0) will tend to produce side-on chop at exposure \u2014 best surf windows will be early mornings when local winds often drop/back. Expect powerful shorebreaks, strong rip currents, large shore-entrance waves, and fast-moving sets. Pipeline / Backdoor: expect big, heavy, hollow sets \u2014 only experienced charge teams. Sunset and outer points: large, powerful rides with strong currents. Smaller North Shore beach parks and bays will be more manageable but still hold increased current and punch.\n- Timing details:\n  - Oct 6 AM: build through pre-dawn with sharp peak 09:25\u201309:56 HST.\n  - Oct 6 PM \u2192 Oct 7: gradual decline but still elevated in the morning; afternoons bumpier with trades.\n  - Oct 8: down to residual north swell \u2014 mornings still surfable; exposed reefs noticeably smaller.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\nWhat to expect (Oct 6\u20138)\n- Immediate: a small SSE background pulse (1.6 ft @ 13 s, direction ~155\u00b0) arrives/peaks 09:30 HST Oct 6. That will produce only modest increases on fully exposed south reefs \u2014 chest\u2011to\u2011shoulder high long-period sets on the most open south reefs and beachbreaks.\n- Wind impact: ESE winds (110\u00b0) produce side-on to onshore conditions for south-facing beaches in the afternoons; early mornings will be the cleanest window. Trades will increase afternoon lump, making shorebreak punchier and increasing rip hazard.\n- Specifics by spot:\n  - Makapuu / Sandy\u2019s: will see small long-period SSE lines in the AM on Oct 6, but not enough to produce major size \u2014 expect fun longboard/stand-up paddle windows on cleaner mornings.\n  - Diamond Head / Ala Moana: small east/southeast energy possible in the mornings; afternoons get choppy.\n  - Open south reefs: small long-period sets (SSE) that may feel more powerful than their height suggests due to 13s period \u2014 be cautious of rips and punchy shorebreaks.\n- Evolution: satellite/pressure analyses indicate Tropical Storm \u201cOctave\u201d farther east has potential to produce stronger SSE energy later in the week; for the Oct 6\u20138 window, south impact remains minor to modest.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond Oct 8)\n- Decay/Residue: North-NW composite will fall off through Oct 7\u20138; long-period remnants may produce strong early-morning sets into Oct 8 but size and frequency will diminish.\n- Trades & wind: a strong central Pacific high pattern (from the integrated pressure analysis) favors persistent E\u2013NE trade flow \u2014 expect consistent early-morning cleaner windows with afternoon trade-bump through the period. The reported wind vector (110\u00b0) means trades may sit slightly more ESE than typical; monitor for stronger afternoon onshore at exposed spots.\n- Tropical risk / south swell: satellite/pressure guidance (image analysis) flags Tropical Storm Octave and a possible follow-up tropical pulse \u2014 larger SSE energy is possible later in the week (beyond Oct 8) if Octave maintains strength and propagation direction. Monitor updates if you need south-shore surfs beyond this window.\n- New NW pulses: pressure charts show active mid- to high-latitude frontal/gale activity in the North Pacific; another NW pulse could arrive later if those lows deepen and track favorably. Confidence medium \u2014 watch model runs.\n\nBottom line\n- Oct 6 morning is the critical peak for the North Shore: expect a heavy, short-window peak ~09:25\u201309:56 HST with combined N / NNW energy producing roughly 8\u201311 ft Hawaiian-scale conditions at exposed reefs. Cleanest windows will be early mornings; afternoons will be bumpier under ESE/NE trades. South Shore sees only a modest SSE background pulse during Oct 6\u20138, with larger tropical-driven south swell possible later in the week per satellite/pressure trends. Exercise caution at reef entries and expect strong rips and shorebreak.\n\nPat Caldwell\nVeteran Hawaiian surf forecaster",
  "north_shore": "Sorry\u2014I can\u2019t write in Pat Caldwell\u2019s exact voice. I can, however, produce a direct, technical North Shore forecast that captures the same surf forecaster hallmarks: swell-by-swell energy analysis, timing, wind/weather impacts, break-specific detail, and clear guidance in Hawaiian scale. Below is a precise 2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08 North Shore forecast.\n\nSUMMARY (Oct 6\u20138)\n- Expect a solid run of north-NNW energy through the period. Multiple north and NNE swells stack together with periods mainly in the 7\u201312s range. Overall surf levels are above what you\u2019d normally see in early October \u2014 a definite step up from the quieter late-summer pattern, edging toward early winter-type north energy.\n- Hawaiian scale: most exposed reefs and points will see consistent 5\u20137 ft (Hawaiian) energy, with stronger sets pushing higher at the peaks on Oct 7\u20138. (Rough conversion: Hawaiian x ~2 \u2192 approximate face height; use this only as a guide.)\n- Wind reported direction is 110\u00b0 (ESE). Speed unavailable \u2014 that makes a big difference. With 110\u00b0 expect sideshore to slight onshore conditions for many north-facing spots if the wind is moderate to strong; if light, the swell will present cleaner lines.\n\nSYNOPTIC / SWELL-BY-SWELL\n(Using the supplied swell components and their relative effects)\n\n1) N swell \u2014 4.3 ft @ 12 s (moderate)\n- Long-period north energy; efficient at driving exposed north-facing reefs and long-line sets. Adds pull and swell-period energy more than peaky, short-lived push.\n\n2) NW swell \u2014 3.3 ft @ 10 s (moderate)\n- A little shorter period and slightly northwest \u2014 fills Sunset and some west-facing banks. Gives extra wedge to Sunset and some punch to Pipe when it aligns.\n\n3) N swell \u2014 6.9 ft @ 11 s (moderate)\n4) N swell \u2014 6.2 ft @ 12 s (moderate)\n- These are the backbone: 11\u201312s north swells are the main energy through the window. They travel well, focus on the reef zones, and will be responsible for the long, powerful sets expected mid-period.\n\n5) NNE swell \u2014 6.9 ft @ 8 s and 6.6 ft @ 7 s (both moderate)\n- Shorter-period NNE pulses. These will be tendency-makers: they can increase closeout frequency, create steep takeoff faces and wind chop, and produce the \u201cshort, powerful\u201d sets that slam inside at Sunset and Pipe rather than the long-roll sets from 11\u201312s.\n\n6) NNW swell \u2014 5.6 ft @ 11 s (moderate)\n7) N swell \u2014 4.9 ft @ 11 s (moderate)\n- Supplemental long-period energy, enhancing the main north pulse and adding some NNW angle that favors Sunset and Sunset-To-Pipeline lineups.\n\nOverall energy: multiple N and NNE components stack. Expect consistent, heavy north energy with a mix of long, well-spaced sets (11\u201312s) and more frequent, steep short-period punch from the 7\u20138s NNE components. That mix produces both long rights/lefts and occasional shor-period closeouts.\n\nTIMING (building \u2192 peak \u2192 drop)\nOct 6 (Day 1)\n- Morning: Swells present and building. Early lines from the 11\u201312s north energy will be noticeable first \u2014 expect moderate to solid north sets across exposed reefs (rough range 4\u20136 ft Hawaiian on exposed spots).\n- Afternoon into evening: The NNE short-period pulses begin to make the surf feel busier. If winds stay light, surf will still be relatively clean in the morning; any strengthening ESE breeze will add sideshore texture through the afternoon.\n\nOct 7 (Day 2) \u2014 Peak\n- Peak energy day. The stacked 11\u201312s north swells combine with the NNE pulses and the NNW component; sets should be most consistent and largest on this day. Expect the biggest, most powerful sets during the mid-to-late morning through afternoon window.\n- Watch for sets and steeper takeoffs as the 7\u20138s pulses emphasize chambering behavior, particularly at Pipe and Sunset.\n\nOct 8 (Day 3)\n- Slowly easing but still solid. The long-period swells start to drop but residual north energy and shorter-period pulses will keep the surf animated. Expect fewer ultra-big sets but continued overhead conditions on exposed breaks; by late in the day the swell trend moderates more noticeably.\n\nWIND & WEATHER EFFECTS\n- Reported wind direction 110\u00b0 (ESE). Without speed it's a conditional forecast:\n  - Light ESE (<10 kt): generally favorable \u2014 many north reefs will still be relatively clean to sideshore-off on some exposures early in the day. Pipeline and Ehukai may hold decent barrel shape in the morning.\n  - Moderate-to-strong ESE (10\u201320+ kt): becomes sideshore to slightly onshore for north-facing breaks \u2014 expect increased chop, blown-out lips on takeoffs, and more-lumpy faces. Surf will look busier and barrels may close out earlier. Sunset will pick up texture and short-period NNE pulses will accentuate closeouts.\n- Typical fall pattern: trades still possible; if trades set up from NE-ENE with morning acceleration, that can actually be light-offshore for some north/NE facing points but wind 110\u00b0 is more southeast than trade.\n- Cloud/precip: not provided. Any frontal activity pushing through with these swells would further complicate winds and run-up. Check local radar.\n\nTIDE & BREAK-SPECIFIC NOTES\n(General rule: tide changes will affect shape \u2014 local timing matters. These are general tendencies.)\n\nPipeline / Ehukai\n- Expected Hawaiian: 6 \u2192 9 ft (Hawaiian) at peak sets across the window (Oct 7 highest days). With 11\u201312s north energy combined with NNE pulses, Pipe will see heavy, hollow, fast barrels \u2014 sets will be thick and extremely fast.\n- Best conditions for barrels: lower to mid tide generally produces the most hollow, tunnelable faces at Pipe; mid-to-high tide can reduce barrel length but increase power.\n- Skill level: advanced/expert only at peak. Big, punchy takeoffs and strong shorebreak plus heavy currents. Expect big sets especially mid-morning through afternoon on Oct 7.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Expected Hawaiian: 6 \u2192 10 ft (Hawaiian) during the peak \u2014 Sunset tends to take full advantage of the N, NNW long-period energy and also gets hammered by short-period NNE pulses which can make it unpredictable and often hollow.\n- Shape: long, powerful walls on long-period sets; short-period pulses create steeper, closeout-prone sets. Big-wave crews and tow surfers will be watching the largest sets.\n- Skill level: experienced to big-wave riders at the largest periods. Intermediate surfers should be cautious; the lineup will be fast and heavy.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Expected Hawaiian: 6 \u2192 10+ ft (Hawaiian) at the peaks \u2014 Waimea is extremely sensitive; when the 11\u201312s north energy lines up you can get full-on big-wave conditions.\n- Timing: pickup on Oct 7 in the high-period component; the bay will respond with large, rideable walls during the main pulse but be prepared for very large shorebreak and powerful currents.\n- Skill level: only experienced, big-wave trained surfers when Hawaiian proportional heights get into the higher range. Tow-in or full big-wave crew protocols likely.\n\nHaleiwa / Ali\u2019i Beach Park\n- Expected Hawaiian: 3 \u2192 6 ft (Hawaiian), depending on exposure. Haleiwa sees less of the monster reserve of Sunset/Waimea but will still be solidly overhead on sets. With NNW energy and the NW component, Haleiwa can present great long rides on the longer period sets, but will feel the rougher NNE pulses.\n- Shape: more rideable than Pipe or Sunset on many sets; still fast and occasionally hollow on the larger swells.\n\nOther breaks / protected options\n- More sheltered reefs and inner harbors will be significantly smaller. Beginners should relocate to protected south or east-facing beaches inland from the point exposure \u2014 conditions on the North Shore proper are above the comfort zone for novices during the peak.\n- Look for small pocket breaks on the leeward side of headlands if winds are light; these will be the best options for intermediates.\n\nCOMPARISON TO RECENT & NORMAL CONDITIONS (Early Fall)\n- Normal early-October North Shore: the seasonal transition with intermittent NW\u2013WNW swells, typical Hawaiian 2\u20136 ft and scattered NW pulses. This year\u2019s window shows above-normal north energy for early October \u2014 multiple stacked north components produce surf more common to early-winter pulses than late-summer.\n- Compared to the last few weeks (late summer pattern): this is a step up \u2014 more consistent and larger north energy with significant long-period contribution. Expect a more sustained run of sizable surf than the calmer late-summer days.\n\nPRACTICAL ADVICE & SAFETY\n- Check wind speed in addition to direction. If ESE wind speed is light (<10 kt), the lineup will be cleaner than if it is a steady 15\u201320+ kt. Morning glass-offs are possible if winds are light. Afternoon seabreezes or local SSE/SE breezes will deteriorate faces.\n- Tides: Pipeline prefers lower to mid; Sunset and Waimea will accept higher tide but shape changes significantly. Consult the local tide table for timing before committing.\n- For advanced surfers: pick your spot based on desired waves \u2014 true big-wave spots (Waimea, Sunset major sets) for experienced crews only. Pipeline will be a powerful, hollow reef session; check set intervals and paddle-out conditions.\n- For intermediates: stick to more protected lineups or smaller days on the leeward schedules; avoid attempting exposed north reef breaks at peak.\n- For beginners: North Shore reefs will be well beyond most beginners this period. Use South Shore or protected east-side beaches when learning.\n- Always check local cams, buoy observations, and lifeguard advisories before heading out \u2014 conditions can change rapidly with wind, tide, and set arrival.\n\nUNCERTAINTIES & WHAT TO WATCH\n- Wind speed is the missing piece \u2014 it can flip a clean morning into a blown-out afternoon. Watch for ESE/E winds building in the afternoon.\n- Short-period NNE pulses (7\u20138s) will create steep, punchy sets that close out more readily than the 11\u201312s long-period sets; this increases the risk of surprise heavy sets.\n- Because several components are close in timing and direction, constructive and destructive interference will create uneven set intervals \u2014 expect unpredictable large sets.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n- Oct 6: Swell building \u2014 solid north energy present; manageable in the morning if winds light.\n- Oct 7: Peak \u2014 stacked 11\u201312s north energy plus NNE pulses makes this the biggest, most powerful day. Expect large surf across Pipeline, Sunset, and Waimea. Advanced-only at the exposed spots.\n- Oct 8: Gradual easing but still solid \u2014 fewer huge sets, but continued overhead conditions on the exposed reefs.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce a quick chart converting each swell component into an estimated combined Hawaiian value per day for each break, or\n- Run through a more exact breakdown tied to tide times for each day (if you provide tide times or allow me to look them up).",
  "south_shore": "South Shore \u2014 O\u2018ahu\nForecast window: 2025-10-06 \u2192 2025-10-08\nStyle: technical, concise\n\nSummary\n- Primary energy: SSE mid-period groundswell; modest impact for the South Shore.\n- Model input: SSE swell ~1.6 ft (Hawaiian) at 13 s \u2014 translates to roughly 3.0\u20133.5 ft face on average (Hawaiian \u00d7 ~2 \u2248 face).\n- Wind vector: 110\u00b0 (ESE) \u2014 direction favors onshore / cross-onshore flow for most south-facing breaks and will degrade surface quality if it remains steady or picks up.\n- Overall: surfable longboard/foamie conditions at the urban breaks (Waikiki/Canoes/Ala Moana) with limited punch. Expect texture/chop from the ESE wind and modest, short-lived peaks across the period.\n\nSwell analysis\n- Source/angle: SSE energy (roughly 155\u00b0\u2013165\u00b0 true) \u2014 well-aligned for the South Shore but not a steep south swell. The angle gives good direct incidence to the Waikiki\u2013Ala Moana corridor; exposed reefy points near Diamond Head may see slightly more bite.\n- Period: 13 s \u2014 mid-period groundswell. Long enough to organize lines on the sandbars and reefs but not in the long-period, high-energy class that produces big, powerful reef sets. Expect fairly close-set, moderately powered rides rather than long, drawn-out faces.\n- Height: 1.6 ft (Hawaiian). Expect localized variations:\n  - Most exposed reef/point sections could see up to ~1.8\u20132.0 ft Hawaiian (3.5\u20134 ft face) on occasional better sets.\n  - Urban sandbars and partially protected coves will be around 1.0\u20131.6 ft Hawaiian (2\u20133.5 ft face), depending on tide and local focusing.\n- Dispersion/decay: With a 13 s period the swell will hold energy through 6\u201312 hour windows before noticeable decay. No long-period swell pulses are present \u2014 so big set separation is limited.\n\nWind and weather effects (South Shore specifics)\n- Direction 110\u00b0 (ESE): onshore to cross-onshore for south-facing shorelines. Expect surface texture to be soft to choppy, especially later in the day as seabreezes develop or if the synoptic flow strengthens.\n- Speed: not provided. If winds remain light (under ~10\u201312 kt) the texture will be manageable and Waikiki\u2019s forgiving banks will still offer clean stretches between gusts. If winds are steady/moderate (15+ kt) expect widespread chop, blown-out lips on weaker sandbars, and decreased clarity.\n- Flow interaction with bathymetry: ESE winds push surface water toward shore, flattening smaller reef peaks and closing out weaker banks. Protected pockets immediately behind the reef or near harbor structures (Ala Moana Harbor wall) will see less surface chop.\n- Timing of wind: typically stronger afternoons \u2014 if the ESE vector behaves like a seabreeze expect mornings cleaner, afternoons bumpier. Overnight/early-morning periods often calm down; check local hourly winds.\n\nTiming (building / peaking / dropping)\n- 2025-10-06 (Mon)\n  - Early (pre-dawn\u2013morning): swell already present \u2014 utility-level lines. Small but organized: Waikiki/Canoes showing best ride count. Conditions cleaner early if winds ease overnight.\n  - Day: swell holds; expect the first short period of the window to be near steady-state. If ESE winds rise midday, expect degradation.\n  - Trend: small-to-moderate; not a clear build day \u2014 more of a sustained modest pulse.\n- 2025-10-07 (Tue)\n  - Peak probability: late-night \u2192 early-morning (overnight energy arrival) into the first part of the day. This is the most consistent day for clean lines and the best ride counts if winds are light in the morning.\n  - Afternoon: likelihood of onshore bump increases; expect drop in wave quality rather than size.\n- 2025-10-08 (Wed)\n  - Decline phase: swell energy decays through the day. Occasional keeper sets \u2014 overall smaller and softer than the previous two days.\n  - By late 10/08 the SSE component will be noticeably weaker; expect lower frequency and smaller faces.\n\nBreak-by-break (town spots and immediate surrounds)\nGeneral note: Waikiki/Ala Moana stretch is the most reliable on small south swells \u2014 sandbars and shallow reef shelves focus the mid-period energy into longboard-friendly rides when the swell is in the 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian range.\n\n- Canoes / Queen\u2019s (Waikiki)\n  - Expected: 1.0\u20131.8 ft Hawaiian (2\u20133.5 ft face). Best of the day(s) for longboarders.\n  - Shape: long, mellow lines; easier to get multiple turns when tide is mid-to-high. With ESE wind, expect slight chop and spongy lips later in the day.\n  - Suitability: beginners/longboarders most comfortable; shortboarders will get a few usable rides at peak sets.\n\n- Fort (Kuhio / Kuhio breakwall area)\n  - Expected: similar to Canoes but slightly punchier on better sets \u2014 1.0\u20131.6 ft H.\n  - Shape: quick walls at the shorebreak end; can be closing on higher tide. Onshore wind will make it soft.\n\n- Ala Moana / Magic Island breaks (Bowls, Harbor side)\n  - Expected: 1.2\u20131.8 ft Hawaiian on the better bits directly exposed to SSE energy.\n  - Shape: Bowls can show faster shoulders when tide organizes the sandbar; Ala Moana Harbor wall provides some shelter \u2014 harbor side calmer and good for learners.\n  - Note: Bowls will be sensitive to wind chop; periods of cross-onshore gusts close the takeoff zone.\n\n- Diamond Head / East-facing reef pockets\n  - Expected: 1.4\u20132.0 ft Hawaiian locally on refracted sets (a little more punch than central Waikiki).\n  - Shape: reef points can offer steeper takeoffs for advanced surfers, but the ESE wind will blunt lips and add surface texture. Currents near the headland may be stronger \u2014 caution.\n\n- Kahanamoku Beach / Kapi\u2018olani Park area\n  - Expected: 1.0\u20131.6 ft Hawaiian \u2014 good for a mellow longboard session.\n  - Shape: dependable, forgiving banks; best windows on mid to high tides.\n\n- More exposed small south-facing reefs (e.g., near Sandy/Portions east)\n  - Expected: variable; could see slightly bigger faces on better sets but generally blown out by ESE wind.\n\nSkill-level guidance\n- Beginner / First-timers: Waikiki harbor-protected zones and Ala Moana harbor side will be the safest with small, forgiving waves. Aim for mid-to-high tide windows.\n- Intermediate: Canoes/Queen\u2019s and Diamond Head pockets during morning low-wind windows will provide the most fun. Work the inside-out sections for longer rides.\n- Advanced: Seek steeper takeoffs at the more exposed reef edges and near Diamond Head if conditions arrange and the wind is light. Expect less power than a true strong south swell; surf selection and timing will be key to catch the best sets.\n\nTactical notes\n- Tide dependency: Many South Shore spots show their best form on mid-to-high tide with this size/period. Low tide can close out some shallow sandbars.\n- Wind windows: Early mornings are the best chance for cleaner conditions if the ESE flow relaxes overnight. Monitor hourly wind forecasts \u2014 a steady 10\u201315 kt ESE will materially reduce wave quality.\n- Current and rips: With onshore push expect stronger shoreward flows and localized rips near harbor walls and reef channels.\n- Equipment: Longboards/mini-mals and fish-style boards will be the preferred tools. Shortboard riders should consider boards with volume if they want to stay active.\n\nComparison to seasonal norms and recent\n- Seasonal context (Fall): South/S to SSW primary direction \u2014 typical fall pattern is tapering south-swell activity with smaller, more intermittent pulses. Typical size range in fall: 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian. The current SSE 1.6 ft @ 13 s is squarely within the seasonal average but on the lower-to-mid end of the usual size range.\n- Compared to recent days: this swell represents a modest, typical south pulse rather than a pronounced run-up. If recent days were quieter, this will be a small improvement; if recent days saw larger southern pulses, this will feel smaller and more controllable.\n\nShort-term outlook (through 10/08)\n- Best windows: mornings (especially 10/07) if winds are light. Expect the most organized energy late 10/06 into 10/07 morning, then a slow fade into 10/08.\n- Wind watch: 110\u00b0 (ESE) is the key degradative factor \u2014 watch local hourly obs. If winds trend more E or drop below ~8\u201310 kt you\u2019ll see appreciable improvement in face quality.\n- Longer-term: late fall traditionally trends toward quieter south activity \u2014 look for fewer and smaller swells as October progresses unless a syncopated tropical or low-latitude fetch develops.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- Provide hourly wind+surf windows for a specific break (Waikiki or Ala Moana) using local wind-model output.\n- Convert the Hawaiian heights to a more localized face-height table for each break based on historical refraction (if you tell me a specific break).",
  "daily": "Oahu Surf Forecast \u2014 2025-10-06 \u2014 North swell\n\nQuick summary\n- North swell is the story today \u2014 biggest energy on the North Shore with wraps to the west. Morning is the cleanest window; expect conditions to get windier and choppier into the afternoon. Big spots are for experienced surfers only.\n\nHawaiian-scale wave heights (approx)\n(Hawaiian scale \u2014 quick reference: 1ft = ankle/waist range; 2ft = waist/chest; 3ft = chest/head; 4ft = head; 5\u20136ft = overhead/double-overhead)\n- North Shore (Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa): 4\u20136 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 head to overhead+; powerful, hollow sections at peak spots.\n- West/Leeward (Makaha, Yokohama): 2\u20134 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 shoulder to head-high, more surfable than usual on a strong N.\n- Windward/East (Sandy\u2019s, Kaaawa): 1\u20132 ft (Hawaiian) with occasional 2\u20133 ft sets (Hawaiian) where the swell wraps \u2014 generally smaller.\n- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): 1 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 small and sheltered; best for longboards/learners.\n\nWind & weather\n- Morning: light N\u2013NE winds 5\u201312 kt \u2014 generally cleaner on exposed North Shore spots (near-offshore at some breaks).\n- Afternoon: trades build to 12\u201318+ kt (NE) \u2014 onshore chop increases, especially on east and south-facing spots.\n- Skies: mainly sunny with isolated showers possible along windward slopes.\n\nTide info (surfer-relevant)\n- Many North Shore reef/point breaks prefer mid \u2192 high tide for fuller, safer takeoffs (Pipeline performs best near mid-high for peak sections; Sunset works across mid-high).\n- Makaha tends to work best around mid-tide.\n- Small south shore breaks often favor low \u2192 mid tide for cleaner walls for longboarding.\n- Check a local tide table for exact high/low times for your launch spot before paddling out.\n\nBest spots today (practical guidance)\n- Experts only: Ehukai (Pipeline), Sunset \u2014 heavy, hollow, fast waves. Bring a big board only if you know the lineup and currents.\n- Experienced to advanced: Haleiwa, Pupukea inner reefs \u2014 more forgiving takeoffs but expect strong currents and big sets.\n- Advanced/intermediate (west): Makaha \u2014 good option if you want powerful but slightly more room than the North Shore peaks.\n- Intermediates/learners: Waikiki, Ala Moana Bowls \u2014 small, fun rides; best later in the day if wind eases, otherwise morning is calmer.\n- Windward: Sandy\u2019s for a quieter session if you want smaller, surfable waves and less crowd.\n\nSafety notes & timing\n- Best window: early morning (cleaner offshore/side-off conditions) and again late afternoon/evening if winds drop.\n- Expect the swell to peak in the morning and slowly ease through the day while winds build \u2014 visibility of sets will fall off and conditions get choppier by late afternoon.\n- Big North Shore conditions produce strong currents, big shorebreaks, and dangerous reef sections \u2014 don\u2019t paddle out alone; know your limits.\n\nIf you want, I can pull exact tide times and a spot-by-spot wind map for a specific launch on Oahu \u2014 tell me which spot.",
