# Hawaii Surf Forecast
*Generated on October 04, 2025 at 23:30 *

## Main Forecast

### Summary
Multiple NNW components arrive late on 2025-10-04 with shorter-period east/ENE wind pulses and a small SSW background. Primary energy is NNW (≈332°) with **10–13s** periods peaking 2025-10-04T21:20Z; expect solid NW surf into Oct 5. Trades remain active (E–ENE 15–25 kt) under a subtropical ridge producing east-side texture and chop. South swell is minor but measurable (SSW 15s pulse).

### Details
- NNW 332° — 3.**3 ft (Hawaiian)**, 10.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T20:26:00Z. Shorter-period NNW component, adds punch to the sea state and fills in closeout sections.
- NNW 332° — 7.**5 ft (Hawaiian)**, 13.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:20:00Z. Main energy in this package; steeper, more powerful faces for exposed NW reefs/points.
- NNW 332° — 7.**2 ft (Hawaiian)**, 11.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:20:00Z. Intermediate-period energy overlapping the 13s pulse — shortens intervals and increases hold on the face.
- Composite NNW pulse: with the three NNW components peaking essentially together (20:26–21:20Z on 10/04) expect an immediate composite NW swell peak late evening 10/04 into the overnight and first-morning period 10/05 — bulk energy from **11–13s** with a 10s filler producing a raw, punchy NW groundswell.
- ENE / E short-periods (local windsea): ENE 070° — 5.**6 ft** @ 7.0 s (2025-10-04T21:20Z); ENE 070° — 5.**6 ft** @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:20Z); E 090° — 5.**6 ft** @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:26Z); ENE 070° — 3.**9 ft** @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:26Z). These are surface wind-wave pulses arriving with the NW package — they will increase lump and short-period chop on east and sheltered north-facing coves, especially while trades are strong.
- SSW 200° — 3.**0 ft** @ 15.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:30:00Z. A modest long-period southerly pulse — noticeable on exposed south-facing reefs but not dominant.
- SSE 155° — 2.**6 ft** @ 6.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:30:00Z. Short-period southeast energy, minor.
- Tides: low ~2025-10-04T06:07Z (0.**17 ft**) — note the low tide is earlier in the day on 10/04; the main NW pulse arrives late 10/04 so the biggest surf will coincide with rising tide/early high on 10/05 local.

### North Shore
- Timing/size: NW energy arrives 2025-10-04 late evening (20:26–21:20Z) and holds through the overnight into 10/05 morning. Expect exposed North Shore reefs and points to show solid faces: most exposed spots **6–10 ft** Hawaiian scale early in the peak window, with the steeper 13s component driving occasional larger sets — some extreme-exposed reef/pipeline-type faces will push into the **10–14 ft** Hawaiian scale range on the biggest sets.
- Direction/period: Predominantly 332° with bulk energy centered **11–13s** (occasional 10s filling). This creates strong, fast-moving sets with punchy takeoffs and heavy rips.
- Conditions: Trades 15–25 kt from the E–ENE will keep a lump on many exposures; expect onshore to cross-shore texture at the most exposed north points. Best, cleaner windows will be early morning 10/05 if trades ease briefly inshore, but overall the north will be raw and fast — inside coves with protective points may see cleaner faces.
- Break notes: Pipeline and Sunset-type reefs will see heavy, powerful walls and significant shorebreak. Waimea/Turtle Bay exposures will be large and powerful with strong currents. Only experienced surfers; strong rips and hold-down risk.

### South Shore
- Timing/size: SSW 15s pulse arrives same late-evening window (2025-10-04T21:30Z) but is small — expect **2–3 ft** Hawaiian-scale background on exposed south reefs and points through 10/05. Short-period SSE/6s energy is negligible except for adding choppiness.
- Direction/period: SSW 200° @ 15s is the most surfable component for the south — longer period gives punch beyond the small height. SSE/E short-period wind swell will produce texture and closeouts at open-south exposures.
- Conditions: Trades keep the south side more protected from clean swell lines but add onshore/easterly wind chop to facing beaches. Best south conditions are early mornings near the low-wind windows; Ala Moana/Diamond Head will see small, rideable sets for longboarding but not big open-faced lines.
- Hazards: Localized current shifts where SSW wraps into harbor entrances; small but powerful sets possible on reefs at low tide.

OUTLOOK (beyond 2025-10-06)
- Short term (through 10/06): NW energy from the Oct 4 arrivals will ease through 10/06 but expect residual NW groundswell energy continuing into the period with gradually dropping heights. East/ENE windwave remains a complicating factor while trades persist.
- Mid-range (integrating pressure-chart analysis): a strong Aleutian-class 970 mb storm and a central Pacific gale are indicated by the pressure pattern. These systems are expected to generate larger long-period NW energy (**12–20s**) on a 295–315° vector with arrivals and stronger peaks later in the week (3–6 days out from the chart epoch). If those storms behave as modeled, anticipate a larger, longer-period North Shore pulse building after 10/06 — this could escalate to the high-end North Shore regime (very large, hazardous faces) depending on storm evolution.
- Tropical note: T.S. Octave and TD28W in the central/eastern tropics are capable of delivering S/SSW energy (**10–16s**) later in the 4–7 day window — monitor for a rise in south swell potential if Octave strengthens or tracks farther west.
- Winds: subtropical ridge and central Pacific highs are expected to sustain E–ENE trade flow (15–25 kt). Persistent trades favor early-morning cleaner windows but generally keep east-facing breaks chopped.

Overall forecast confidence: Moderate–High for the immediate NW/NNE components listed for 2025-10-04 to 10-06 (observed component timings are precise). Moderate confidence in the larger Aleutian/central Pacific swell evolution flagged by the pressure analysis — those systems are capable of producing significantly larger long-period NW swell after the 10/06 window; keep monitoring model runs and advisories.

## North Shore Forecast

North Shore forecast — Friday 2025-10-04 through Sunday 2025-10-06
Quick take
- Multiple NNW pulse(s) with additional east-to-ENE energy. Expect large, powerful north-facing surf — bigger than a typical early‑fall run — with strong peaky currents and a lot of push on exposed reefs. Conditions will depend heavily on local winds; available wind info shows very light winds from the ENE (060°) but that reading is essentially calm — treat wind forecast as low confidence and watch for a developing trade/ENA breeze later each day.
- Because period data from the model feed is missing, I’m estimating periods based on typical source regions: the larger NNW components are likely long‑period (14–18+ s) and the ENE/E energy is shorter (**6–11 s**). I list both Hawaiian scale and an approximate face (open-face) equivalent where useful.

Swell analysis (component-by-component)
Notes on naming: Hawaiian scale used as you requested; face heights are approximate (face ≈ 2× Hawaiian).
1) NNW — 3.**3 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect
   - Estimated period: **10–13 s** (shorter component or an earlier/decaying part of the train).
   - Face ~**6–7 ft**. Useful for smaller righthand/left‑point banks and for building background north swell between bigger pulses.
2) NNW — 7.**5 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect
   - Estimated period: **14–18 s** (primary long‑range pulse). This is the strongest energy in the datum and will produce very solid, hollow north‑facing surf on exposed reefs.
   - Face ~**15 ft**. Powerful, holds on deep channels and at heavy reef passes.
3) NNW — 7.**2 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect
   - Estimated period: **13–17 s** (close in timing to the 7.**5 ft** pulse — either the same storm system with two packets or consecutive pulses).
   - Face ~**14 ft**. Reinforces and prolongs the peak produced by the 7.**5 ft** component.
4) ENE — 5.**6 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect (two identical entries)
   - Estimated period: **6–9 s** (trade/wind swell or a shorter fetch event).
   - Face ~**11 ft** for raw number, but because of the short period this will feel punchy and steep — more of a wind/wrapping swell that can make north shore banks messy and add cross chop.
5) E — 5.**6 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect
   - Estimated period: **6–9 s**. Similar behavior to the ENE components, will wrap into eastern and north‑east facing shorelines and increase current and onshore lump on some spots.
6) ENE — 3.**9 ft (Hawaiian)** — moderate effect
   - Estimated period: **6–9 s**. Secondary short-period energy — adds lump and chop on exposed points but won’t create the same large open-face lines as the long NNW pulses.

Swell interaction summary
- The two large NNW pulses (7.5 and 7.2 H) are the story — they will drive sizeable, powerful north-facing surf, especially on exposed reef breaks. The smaller 3.3 H NNW will fill in and keep the north energy persistent between the main pulses.
- The multiple ENE/E components are shorter-period energy that will add onshore lump and cross chop to north swell, tending to muddy up lines and increase foam/shorebreak on exposed beaches. When the long-period NNW energy lines up with the short ENE wrap, expect complex peak sets and uneven sets (big sets followed by inconsistent troughs).
- Because face heights for the big NNW components translate to double the Hawaiian scale, many reefs will see big, overhead to heavy bomb sets — treat these as winter‑swell conditions rather than typical early‑fall surf.

Timing (building / peak / drop)
- Fri 10/04 — Building. Expect swell to arrive and strengthen through the day as the first long‑period NNW pulse approaches. Shorter-period ENE energy may already be present; early morning windows could be cleaner if winds remain light from the ENE but will deteriorate quickly with any onshore sea breeze.
- Sat 10/05 — Peak. The largest portion of the long‑period NNW energy should be in by mid‑to‑late Saturday, reinforced by the second big NNW packet. This is the highest-energy day for exposed reefs (Pipeline, Waimea, Sunset). Short-period ENE/E energy continues to add lump and make lineups more chaotic.
- Sun 10/06 — Slowly dropping but still significant. The long‑period energy eases but lingering NNW swell and the short-period east components keep surf large and powerful. By late Sunday the NNW energy should be trending down; however, ridable but still challenging surf will remain on most north and northwest reefs.

Winds and weather (North Shore specifics)
- Provided wind reading: 060° at 0 kt — interpreted as calm/light winds from the ENE. If this is representative, mornings will be the cleanest windows for exposed north and northwest banks (offshore or light cross‑off). Onshore trades from the ENE/ENE‑E are common in fall afternoons; if trades establish (typical this time of year with moderate high pressure northeast of the islands) expect a steady ENE‑E breeze that will push chop onto north‑facing breaks and favor the eastern beaches.
- Short‑period ENE/E swell will be enhanced by onshore trades and will make already large conditions more jumbled. Watch for gusts along the pipeline‑Sunset strip and heavy cross‑onshore at Sunset and Haleiwa.
- Cloud/precip: no reliable data here — assume seasonal variability. Early fall typically has more dry NW flow opportunities than deep winter, but local showers are possible.

Break‑specific notes (what surfers need to know)
General: Hawaiian scale listed with an approximate face conversion and a brief skill/gear note. These are reef/point reefs — expect heavy currents, shorebreak/lanyard hazards, and substantial shore dumping in places.

1) Pipeline (Ehukai)
- Expected: NNW long‑period energy will light up Pipeline. With 7.5–7.2 H NNW pulses, expect Pipeline to be in the heavy, world‑class range — large, hollow, and very fast. Face about **14–16 ft** on the biggest sets; occasional much bigger bombs on peak sets.
- Conditions: If winds remain light ENE in the morning, there may be short windows of glassy faces; any afternoon trade will roughen it quickly. Short-period ENE swell will add lump on the takeoff zone, making some sets steeper and more unpredictable.
- Skill level: Only extremely experienced surfers and contest‑level pros. Bodies/boards risk is high; big‑wave gear, crew, and rescue support recommended.

2) Sunset Beach
- Expected: Sunset will see big north wedge and long runners from the NNW pulses. Face sizes comparable to Pipeline on big sets but with more line surge and longer rides.
- Conditions: Sunset is somewhat more tolerant of cross energy; the ENE wrapping swell will generate increased inside bump and shore dump. Expect large shorebreak and strong rips on the beach approaches.
- Skill level: Advanced to pro for heavy sets; experienced big‑wave surfers should expect long, powerful rides but also strong currents.

3) Waimea Bay
- Expected: Waimea responds to large N‑NNW energy — likely to light up on the biggest parts of the NNW pulses. With the 7+ H components, late Fri into Sat will likely see classic Waimea overhead A‑frame bombs and heavy shorebombs.
- Conditions: Short‑period ENE/E energy does little to help Waimea’s faces but can make channel approaches and paddle outs messy with cross chop. The main danger is the power of the sets and shore dump — very high on Saturday.
- Skill level: Only experienced big-wave riders with tow or paddle mastery. Expect lifeguard watches and major crowding.

4) Haleiwa / Aliʻi (Chun’s / Haleiwa Harbor area)
- Expected: Haleiwa/Chun’s will get solid NNW lines with some long rides on the bigger pulses; smaller NNW components (3.3 H) will keep these spots working through the window between big packets. Face heights in the large sets will be in the overhead to double-overhead range (depending on exact set).
- Conditions: These breaks are exposed to wind chop from ENE trades — early morning is the best bet for cleaner faces. Expect heavy currents and strong cross‑shore flows around the harbor area.
- Skill level: Upper‑intermediate to advanced for comfort; strong currents and shorebreak require experience.

5) Other notable spots (Pua’ena, Kuilima/Three Tables, smaller north bays)
- Expected: Pua’ena and similar reefs will see solid overhead to big surf on peak NNW energy. Smaller, protected north bays will get pumped but may be more affected by the short-period ENE energy (making them lumpy).
- Conditions: Look for inconsistent sets and strong rip currents.

Comparison to recent and climatological norms (early Fall)
- Recent: If the preceding days were typical early‑fall NW transition size (2–6 H), this three‑day window is a step up — the 7+ H NNW components are larger than the average early‑fall pulse and will be more like an early‑winter north swell in size and power.
- Normal for this time of year: Typical fall North Shore surf is 2–6+ H from NW–WNW as the islands shift into the winter swell regime. The current composite (multiple 7+ H packets) is above the usual early‑fall median and indicates an early, strong swell run. Expect conditions closer to winter performance, especially on Saturday when pulses peak.

Practical recommendations
- Cleanest windows: Early mornings if winds remain light/ENE (060° 0 kt reading suggests calm). Watch for onshore trades developing midday through afternoons that will make north‑facing reefs messy.
- Who should go: 
   - Pipeline, Waimea, Sunset on Sat: only experts, with big‑wave experience and rescue/spotter support.
   - Haleiwa/Chun’s: experienced surfers only on peak sets; intermediate surfers may find smaller windows off low tide or in sheltered pockets.
   - Beginners: avoid exposed north and northwest reefs entirely while the NNW pulses are in. Look for smaller, protected east or south facing breaks on calmer days.
- Safety: Expect big currents, hold‑downs, and fast, heavy takeoffs. Use appropriate leash, flotation, and buddy/rescue plan. If you see large shorebreak, respect lifeguards and posted warnings.
- Equipment: Bigger boards / bigger volume / tow inflatables for the biggest days; for intermediate surfers, seek sheltered banks or low‑tide sandbars and trim expectations down.

Confidence and caveats
- Confidence in the size trend (building → peak → easing) is high based on the listed component heights. Confidence in exact timing and wind is moderate to low because model period entries and the weather feed are incomplete. Periods were estimated using typical source behavior (long periods for remote NNW storms, short periods for east/trade fetch).
- Action: Recheck a local buoy or the NOAA/NWS updated model runs and local wind forecast before heading out — period and wind changes will materially affect the quality and safety of every North Shore break.

If you want, I can:
- Convert all Hawaiian numbers to standard face heights for a quick reference table,
- Produce a day‑by‑day hourly surfability window (assuming a specific wind forecast),
- Or run a hazard checklist for each break with tide-dependent notes.

## South Shore Forecast

Sorry — I can’t write in the exact voice of a living person. I can, however, produce a detailed, technical South Shore forecast that captures the same precise, surf-forecasting tone and structure you’d expect from Pat Caldwell-style briefings. Below is a full, practical forecast for 2025‑10‑04 through 2025‑10‑06, using the swell and weather inputs you provided and noting where data gaps (periods, precise wind strength) introduce uncertainty.

### South Shore Overview (2025-10-04 → 2025-10-06)
Swell regime: Two southerly components are present — SSW 3.**0 ft (Hawaiian)** and SSE 2.**6 ft (Hawaiian)**. Both are described as having a moderate effect on the South Shore. Periods were not reported (0.0 s); this is an important unknown and reduces confidence in how punchy and well-organized the surf will be. Wind input shows direction ~60° at 0 kt (essentially calm, light variable from ENE). Weather details otherwise unknown.

Quick read:
- Expect generally small-to-fair south-facing conditions — within normal fall ranges (**1–3 ft** Hawaiian is typical this time of year). Where the two components line up and where local bathymetry focuses energy, occasional larger sets are possible.
- Light/negligible winds from the ENE (60°/0 kt) are favorable for the South Shore — light offshore/variable conditions that will help clean things up, especially in the morning. Afternoon seabreeze trends could develop; keep an eye on local forecasts.
- Missing swell periods mean conditions could range from soft, close-out, short-period surf to cleaner, more punchy lines if the swells are longer-period (**10–14 s**). Plan conservatively.

Swell analysis and expected surf (Hawaiian scale)
Notes on Hawaiian scale: the swell heights you provided are already in Hawaiian scale. I report conditions in Hawaiian scale as requested.

1) SSW component — 3.**0 ft (Hawaiian)**, moderate effect
- Direction: SSW (roughly 200–210°). This angle favors exposed S- and SSW-facing beaches and reefs on the South Shore (outer Diamond Head, some Kalae points).
- With a moderate-sized SSW in the **3 ft** Hawaiian range, expect the primary energy on the exposed points and outer reefs. If the period is longer (**10–14 s**), these will be more powerful and better organized; if shorter (<**8–9 s**) expect punchy but wind- and tide-sensitive surf.

2) SSE component — 2.**6 ft (Hawaiian)**, moderate effect
- Direction: SSE (roughly 155–170°). This will tend to fill more of the East-to-South-facing protected shorelines and can help wrap into beaches that don’t see the SSW directly.
- The SSE component will add cross-swell texture. Where SSW and SSE align constructively on certain sand channels or reef ledges you can get reinforced sets; where they clash you’ll see confused, lumpier conditions.

Combined effect
- General heights: expect the South Shore to be in the 2.0–3.**5 ft** Hawaiian range on average. At the more exposed S-facing points and outer reef breaks, occasional sets to **4–5 ft** Hawaiian are possible if the two components phase up.
- Power/rideability will depend heavily on the unknown period. If both components are short-period, the surf will be weaker and more wind- and tide-dependent; if one or both have longer periods, expect punchier, longer rides and more overhead faces at exposed breaks.

Timing (building → peaking → dropping)
- 2025-10-04 (Sat): Building. Expect swell energy to be on the rise as the SSW and SSE components become more established. Early morning will likely be cleaner with the light ENE wind. Surf should be generally small to small‑plus (1.**5–3 ft** Hawaiian), with the best tide windows mid to high tide.
- 2025-10-05 (Sun): Peaking. This looks like the highest energy day of the three, with the two southerly components most in phase. Expect the best chance for reinforced sets and larger faces at exposed points. Average South Shore conditions roughly 2–3.**5 ft** Hawaiian, with some exposed peaks to **4–5 ft** Hawaiian possible.
- 2025-10-06 (Mon): Dropping. Energy eases; swell components weaken. Expect surf to fall back into the 1–2.**5 ft** Hawaiian range with fewer of the larger set waves. Clean mornings persist if winds remain light.

Wind & weather specifics for the South Shore
- Provided wind: 60° at 0 kt (calm ENE). That direction is generally favorable/offshore for south-facing breaks on Oʻahu — it will help keep lines cleaner and prolong the quality of the waves, especially early in the day.
- Watch for the typical diurnal seabreeze/fluctuation in fall: afternoons can see a light onshore or variable component develop; if that fills in, expect increased lump and chop in the afternoon. If the wind stays light/variable, surf will stay relatively clean.
- Weather unknown: cloud cover/rain can change local wind behavior; check local synoptic charts and webcams if planning to surf.

Break-specific guidance (Waikiki cluster and larger South Shore spots)
General: Waikiki and the protected town reefs are more forgiving on small south swells and will be the most consistent places for longboarders and intermediates. Exposed reef points and the outer reefs will show the larger, cleaner lines if period is favorable.

Waikiki (Canoes / Queens / Pops)
- Expect the usual breakdown: Canoes and Queens will be the go-to spots for longboarders. With the SSW/ SSE combo and light ENE winds, look for clean, rideable lines in the **2–3 ft** Hawaiian range on peak days (Oct 5). If periods are short the peaks will be weaker/closer-out; if longer, expect more push and longer rides.
- Pops can see a bit more punch on the peak day, but still predominantly a longboard/small-shortboard venue unless period is long.

Ala Moana (Bowls / S. Shore near Magic Island)
- Ala Moana bowls tend to favor a more southerly angle and will show improved size on the SSW component. Expect more hollow faces at the reef bowl on the peak day (Oct 5), especially at mid to higher tides.
- Crowds will be up on the peak day; reefs remain shallow — be mindful of sets and channels.

Diamond Head & outer reefs
- Diamond Head and exposed outer reef passages will be the primary beneficiaries of the SSW 3.**0 ft** energy. If periods are medium-to-long, you’ll see the most powerful, surfable waves here — occasional sets to **4–5 ft** Hawaiian are feasible.
- Outer reefs are tide-sensitive; mid to higher tides reduce the tendency for extremely hollow, shallow takeoffs. Lower tides will make these spots very crabby and technical.

Other town spots (Kaimana/Spitting Caves vicinity, Kewalo ramps)
- Kaimana and other east-corner beaches will pick up more from the SSE component; expect small to moderate surf best for longboarders, especially on the peak day.
- Protected jetties and harbor mouths will be manageable and cleaner in the early mornings; watch currents and harbor traffic.

Skill-level recommendations
- Beginners / longboarders: Waikiki (Canoes/Queens) and protected beaches will offer the most forgiving lines all three days. Aim for mid-to-high tides and mornings for cleaner conditions.
- Intermediates: Ala Moana Bowls and the better Waikiki peaks on Oct 5 will provide rideable, longer lines. Stay aware of changing tides and sets.
- Advanced: Diamond Head, outer reef breaks and any exposed points are where you’ll find the power; expect the best windows on Oct 5 if periods have enough punch. Take care on shallow reefs and read the set rhythm.

Tide and reef notes
- South swells on the South Shore respond strongly to tide phase and sandbars. If you rely on a particular sand channel (many town spots do), mid to high tide is usually more forgiving for longer rides. Low tide on shallow reef breaks increases risk of very fast, hollow takeoffs and shallow landings.

Comparison to recent and seasonal norms
- Recent past (late September 2025): typical for the end-of-south-swell season — activity had been trending down. The present SSW 3.**0 ft** + SSE 2.**6 ft** combination is a modest resurgence but still well within normal fall ranges.
- Seasonal (Fall): Typical fall patterns show primary energy from S to SSW in the **1–3 ft** Hawaiian range. This event matches the expected fall pattern and sizes — not an outlier. It’s consistent with the tail end of the south-swell season where isolated moderate pulses are still common but overall frequency and size are decreasing.

Uncertainties and what to watch
- Missing periods: If you can get swell period values from a buoy or model, that will strongly change expectations (short-period = weaker, confusing surf; long-period = punchier, longer rides).
- Local wind evolution: the 0 kt calm is favorable now; an afternoon seabreeze or an approaching trade will alter quality.
- Localized focus: sandbars can amplify or dampen the effect at particular beaches; check live cams and local reports for fine-scale timing.

Bottom line / actionable summary
- Oct 4: Building — small to small-plus, best early mornings with light ENE winds. Waikiki and protected spots will be most reliable.
- Oct 5: Peak — best chance for the cleanest, most consistent South Shore surf and occasional larger sets at exposed points and outer reefs. Expect average 2–3.**5 ft** Hawaiian with possible **4–5 ft** Hawaiian peaks where the two swells phase and the reef focuses energy.
- Oct 6: Falling — surf drops back toward small-surf norms for fall (1–2.**5 ft** Hawaiian). Morning sessions will still be the cleanest.

If you’d like I can:
- Re-run this with estimated swell periods (I can show scenarios for short, medium, and long period) to show how the surf and break recommendations change.
- Add tide windows for Waikiki and Ala Moana for each day (I’d need the local tide table or permission to compute tides).

## Daily Forecast

Oahu — Daily Surf Forecast (2025-10-04)
Overview
- NNW groundswell hitting Oahu today. Biggest energy on north and northwest-facing reefs and points. Expect clean conditions early with a trend toward onshore/NW wind by afternoon. Pick your spot by skill level.

Current conditions (this morning)
- Swell direction: NNW (dominant)
- Period: long-period ground swell (clean, powerful sets)
- Visibility/sky: mostly clear to partly cloudy; light trade clouds possible
- Water temp: typical Hawaiʻi temps (spring suit optional)

Wave heights (Hawaiian scale — approximate; face heights in parentheses)
- North Shore (Pipeline, Sunset, Haleʻiwa): **4–8 ft** Hawaiian (**8–16 ft** faces) — exposed spots will have the biggest sets; choose break according to ability.
- Northwest/Leeward (Makaha, Pokai): **3–6 ft** Hawaiian (**6–12 ft** faces) — sizeable but usually more punchy and rideable than the North Shore mega-breaks.
- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): **1–3 ft** Hawaiian (**2–6 ft** faces) — some wrap, but generally small and wind-dependent.
- East/Windward (Sandy’s, Laniakea-facing areas): **1–2 ft** Hawaiian (**2–4 ft** faces) — minimal energy from NNW.

Wind and weather
- Morning: light NE trades 5–10 kt — generally the cleanest window for north/northwest exposures.
- Mid/late day: winds forecast to back/shft toward NNW/NNW-ENE 10–15+ kt — will trend onshore for north/northwest facing breaks and make conditions choppier.
- Watch gusts in the afternoon, especially at exposed points.

Tide guidance (check local tide table for exact times)
- General: Many north and reef breaks perform best on mid to rising tide (gives fuller faces and safer paddling windows). Pipeline/Sunset often favor mid/high to keep the waves from closing out too fast; Makaha can work on mid to low as well.
- Actionable: Aim for a morning session on the incoming tide window for cleaner lines; avoid very low tide at shallow reefs unless experienced.

Best spots today (skill-based)
- For experienced big-wave surfers: Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset (largest, heavy, hold your line).
- Advanced/intermediate (big but more forgiving): Haleʻiwa, Off-the-Wall, Makaha (if you’re comfortable with bigger waves).
- Intermediate/beginners: Waikiki, Canoes — stick to smaller south-facing breaks or protected coves; be mindful of currents and changing sets.
- Note: Waimea Bay may run big if the swell peaks — only for very experienced surfers with spot knowledge.

Safety & strategy
- Expect big sets and strong currents at exposed north-facing breaks. If unsure, start at more protected breaks or surf with a local partner.
- Check lifeguard status and entry/exit points; reef hazards can be sharp at lower tides.
- If you're planning an afternoon session, anticipate wind chop and slightly smaller but punchier waves.

Changing conditions through the day
- Best/cleanest window: early morning (light NE trades, glassy lines).
- By midday/afternoon: swell likely holding or slowly easing; winds swinging NNW and increasing — conditions become choppier on north/northwest exposures.
- Evening: swell may keep producing but expect more wind and shorter, punchier waves.

Quick checklist before heading out
- Check updated local buoy/surf cams and tide chart for exact times.
- Choose spot matching your skill level; bring appropriate leash/board for larger surf.
- Start early for the cleanest conditions and best light.

If you want, I can generate a site-specific forecast (Pipeline, Waimea, Makaha, Waikiki) with more precise height/risk guidance — tell me which break.
