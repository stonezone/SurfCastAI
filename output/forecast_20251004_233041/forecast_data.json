  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nMultiple NNW components arrive late on 2025-10-04 with shorter-period east/ENE wind pulses and a small SSW background. Primary energy is NNW (\u2248332\u00b0) with 10\u201313s periods peaking 2025-10-04T21:20Z; expect solid NW surf into Oct 5. Trades remain active (E\u2013ENE 15\u201325 kt) under a subtropical ridge producing east-side texture and chop. South swell is minor but measurable (SSW 15s pulse).\n\nDETAILS\n- NNW 332\u00b0 \u2014 3.3 ft (Hawaiian), 10.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T20:26:00Z. Shorter-period NNW component, adds punch to the sea state and fills in closeout sections.\n- NNW 332\u00b0 \u2014 7.5 ft (Hawaiian), 13.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:20:00Z. Main energy in this package; steeper, more powerful faces for exposed NW reefs/points.\n- NNW 332\u00b0 \u2014 7.2 ft (Hawaiian), 11.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:20:00Z. Intermediate-period energy overlapping the 13s pulse \u2014 shortens intervals and increases hold on the face.\n- Composite NNW pulse: with the three NNW components peaking essentially together (20:26\u201321:20Z on 10/04) expect an immediate composite NW swell peak late evening 10/04 into the overnight and first-morning period 10/05 \u2014 bulk energy from 11\u201313s with a 10s filler producing a raw, punchy NW groundswell.\n- ENE / E short-periods (local windsea): ENE 070\u00b0 \u2014 5.6 ft @ 7.0 s (2025-10-04T21:20Z); ENE 070\u00b0 \u2014 5.6 ft @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:20Z); E 090\u00b0 \u2014 5.6 ft @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:26Z); ENE 070\u00b0 \u2014 3.9 ft @ 6.0 s (2025-10-04T21:26Z). These are surface wind-wave pulses arriving with the NW package \u2014 they will increase lump and short-period chop on east and sheltered north-facing coves, especially while trades are strong.\n- SSW 200\u00b0 \u2014 3.0 ft @ 15.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:30:00Z. A modest long-period southerly pulse \u2014 noticeable on exposed south-facing reefs but not dominant.\n- SSE 155\u00b0 \u2014 2.6 ft @ 6.0 s. Arrival/peak: 2025-10-04T21:30:00Z. Short-period southeast energy, minor.\n- Tides: low ~2025-10-04T06:07Z (0.17 ft) \u2014 note the low tide is earlier in the day on 10/04; the main NW pulse arrives late 10/04 so the biggest surf will coincide with rising tide/early high on 10/05 local.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Timing/size: NW energy arrives 2025-10-04 late evening (20:26\u201321:20Z) and holds through the overnight into 10/05 morning. Expect exposed North Shore reefs and points to show solid faces: most exposed spots 6\u201310 ft Hawaiian scale early in the peak window, with the steeper 13s component driving occasional larger sets \u2014 some extreme-exposed reef/pipeline-type faces will push into the 10\u201314 ft Hawaiian scale range on the biggest sets.\n- Direction/period: Predominantly 332\u00b0 with bulk energy centered 11\u201313s (occasional 10s filling). This creates strong, fast-moving sets with punchy takeoffs and heavy rips.\n- Conditions: Trades 15\u201325 kt from the E\u2013ENE will keep a lump on many exposures; expect onshore to cross-shore texture at the most exposed north points. Best, cleaner windows will be early morning 10/05 if trades ease briefly inshore, but overall the north will be raw and fast \u2014 inside coves with protective points may see cleaner faces.\n- Break notes: Pipeline and Sunset-type reefs will see heavy, powerful walls and significant shorebreak. Waimea/Turtle Bay exposures will be large and powerful with strong currents. Only experienced surfers; strong rips and hold-down risk.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Timing/size: SSW 15s pulse arrives same late-evening window (2025-10-04T21:30Z) but is small \u2014 expect 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian-scale background on exposed south reefs and points through 10/05. Short-period SSE/6s energy is negligible except for adding choppiness.\n- Direction/period: SSW 200\u00b0 @ 15s is the most surfable component for the south \u2014 longer period gives punch beyond the small height. SSE/E short-period wind swell will produce texture and closeouts at open-south exposures.\n- Conditions: Trades keep the south side more protected from clean swell lines but add onshore/easterly wind chop to facing beaches. Best south conditions are early mornings near the low-wind windows; Ala Moana/Diamond Head will see small, rideable sets for longboarding but not big open-faced lines.\n- Hazards: Localized current shifts where SSW wraps into harbor entrances; small but powerful sets possible on reefs at low tide.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 2025-10-06)\n- Short term (through 10/06): NW energy from the Oct 4 arrivals will ease through 10/06 but expect residual NW groundswell energy continuing into the period with gradually dropping heights. East/ENE windwave remains a complicating factor while trades persist.\n- Mid-range (integrating pressure-chart analysis): a strong Aleutian-class 970 mb storm and a central Pacific gale are indicated by the pressure pattern. These systems are expected to generate larger long-period NW energy (12\u201320s) on a 295\u2013315\u00b0 vector with arrivals and stronger peaks later in the week (3\u20136 days out from the chart epoch). If those storms behave as modeled, anticipate a larger, longer-period North Shore pulse building after 10/06 \u2014 this could escalate to the high-end North Shore regime (very large, hazardous faces) depending on storm evolution.\n- Tropical note: T.S. Octave and TD28W in the central/eastern tropics are capable of delivering S/SSW energy (10\u201316s) later in the 4\u20137 day window \u2014 monitor for a rise in south swell potential if Octave strengthens or tracks farther west.\n- Winds: subtropical ridge and central Pacific highs are expected to sustain E\u2013ENE trade flow (15\u201325 kt). Persistent trades favor early-morning cleaner windows but generally keep east-facing breaks chopped.\n\nOverall forecast confidence: Moderate\u2013High for the immediate NW/NNE components listed for 2025-10-04 to 10-06 (observed component timings are precise). Moderate confidence in the larger Aleutian/central Pacific swell evolution flagged by the pressure analysis \u2014 those systems are capable of producing significantly larger long-period NW swell after the 10/06 window; keep monitoring model runs and advisories.",
  "north_shore": "North Shore forecast \u2014 Friday 2025-10-04 through Sunday 2025-10-06\nQuick take\n- Multiple NNW pulse(s) with additional east-to-ENE energy. Expect large, powerful north-facing surf \u2014 bigger than a typical early\u2011fall run \u2014 with strong peaky currents and a lot of push on exposed reefs. Conditions will depend heavily on local winds; available wind info shows very light winds from the ENE (060\u00b0) but that reading is essentially calm \u2014 treat wind forecast as low confidence and watch for a developing trade/ENA breeze later each day.\n- Because period data from the model feed is missing, I\u2019m estimating periods based on typical source regions: the larger NNW components are likely long\u2011period (14\u201318+ s) and the ENE/E energy is shorter (6\u201311 s). I list both Hawaiian scale and an approximate face (open-face) equivalent where useful.\n\nSwell analysis (component-by-component)\nNotes on naming: Hawaiian scale used as you requested; face heights are approximate (face \u2248 2\u00d7 Hawaiian).\n1) NNW \u2014 3.3 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect\n   - Estimated period: 10\u201313 s (shorter component or an earlier/decaying part of the train).\n   - Face ~6\u20137 ft. Useful for smaller righthand/left\u2011point banks and for building background north swell between bigger pulses.\n2) NNW \u2014 7.5 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect\n   - Estimated period: 14\u201318 s (primary long\u2011range pulse). This is the strongest energy in the datum and will produce very solid, hollow north\u2011facing surf on exposed reefs.\n   - Face ~15 ft. Powerful, holds on deep channels and at heavy reef passes.\n3) NNW \u2014 7.2 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect\n   - Estimated period: 13\u201317 s (close in timing to the 7.5 ft pulse \u2014 either the same storm system with two packets or consecutive pulses).\n   - Face ~14 ft. Reinforces and prolongs the peak produced by the 7.5 ft component.\n4) ENE \u2014 5.6 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect (two identical entries)\n   - Estimated period: 6\u20139 s (trade/wind swell or a shorter fetch event).\n   - Face ~11 ft for raw number, but because of the short period this will feel punchy and steep \u2014 more of a wind/wrapping swell that can make north shore banks messy and add cross chop.\n5) E \u2014 5.6 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect\n   - Estimated period: 6\u20139 s. Similar behavior to the ENE components, will wrap into eastern and north\u2011east facing shorelines and increase current and onshore lump on some spots.\n6) ENE \u2014 3.9 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 moderate effect\n   - Estimated period: 6\u20139 s. Secondary short-period energy \u2014 adds lump and chop on exposed points but won\u2019t create the same large open-face lines as the long NNW pulses.\n\nSwell interaction summary\n- The two large NNW pulses (7.5 and 7.2 H) are the story \u2014 they will drive sizeable, powerful north-facing surf, especially on exposed reef breaks. The smaller 3.3 H NNW will fill in and keep the north energy persistent between the main pulses.\n- The multiple ENE/E components are shorter-period energy that will add onshore lump and cross chop to north swell, tending to muddy up lines and increase foam/shorebreak on exposed beaches. When the long-period NNW energy lines up with the short ENE wrap, expect complex peak sets and uneven sets (big sets followed by inconsistent troughs).\n- Because face heights for the big NNW components translate to double the Hawaiian scale, many reefs will see big, overhead to heavy bomb sets \u2014 treat these as winter\u2011swell conditions rather than typical early\u2011fall surf.\n\nTiming (building / peak / drop)\n- Fri 10/04 \u2014 Building. Expect swell to arrive and strengthen through the day as the first long\u2011period NNW pulse approaches. Shorter-period ENE energy may already be present; early morning windows could be cleaner if winds remain light from the ENE but will deteriorate quickly with any onshore sea breeze.\n- Sat 10/05 \u2014 Peak. The largest portion of the long\u2011period NNW energy should be in by mid\u2011to\u2011late Saturday, reinforced by the second big NNW packet. This is the highest-energy day for exposed reefs (Pipeline, Waimea, Sunset). Short-period ENE/E energy continues to add lump and make lineups more chaotic.\n- Sun 10/06 \u2014 Slowly dropping but still significant. The long\u2011period energy eases but lingering NNW swell and the short-period east components keep surf large and powerful. By late Sunday the NNW energy should be trending down; however, ridable but still challenging surf will remain on most north and northwest reefs.\n\nWinds and weather (North Shore specifics)\n- Provided wind reading: 060\u00b0 at 0 kt \u2014 interpreted as calm/light winds from the ENE. If this is representative, mornings will be the cleanest windows for exposed north and northwest banks (offshore or light cross\u2011off). Onshore trades from the ENE/ENE\u2011E are common in fall afternoons; if trades establish (typical this time of year with moderate high pressure northeast of the islands) expect a steady ENE\u2011E breeze that will push chop onto north\u2011facing breaks and favor the eastern beaches.\n- Short\u2011period ENE/E swell will be enhanced by onshore trades and will make already large conditions more jumbled. Watch for gusts along the pipeline\u2011Sunset strip and heavy cross\u2011onshore at Sunset and Haleiwa.\n- Cloud/precip: no reliable data here \u2014 assume seasonal variability. Early fall typically has more dry NW flow opportunities than deep winter, but local showers are possible.\n\nBreak\u2011specific notes (what surfers need to know)\nGeneral: Hawaiian scale listed with an approximate face conversion and a brief skill/gear note. These are reef/point reefs \u2014 expect heavy currents, shorebreak/lanyard hazards, and substantial shore dumping in places.\n\n1) Pipeline (Ehukai)\n- Expected: NNW long\u2011period energy will light up Pipeline. With 7.5\u20137.2 H NNW pulses, expect Pipeline to be in the heavy, world\u2011class range \u2014 large, hollow, and very fast. Face about 14\u201316 ft on the biggest sets; occasional much bigger bombs on peak sets.\n- Conditions: If winds remain light ENE in the morning, there may be short windows of glassy faces; any afternoon trade will roughen it quickly. Short-period ENE swell will add lump on the takeoff zone, making some sets steeper and more unpredictable.\n- Skill level: Only extremely experienced surfers and contest\u2011level pros. Bodies/boards risk is high; big\u2011wave gear, crew, and rescue support recommended.\n\n2) Sunset Beach\n- Expected: Sunset will see big north wedge and long runners from the NNW pulses. Face sizes comparable to Pipeline on big sets but with more line surge and longer rides.\n- Conditions: Sunset is somewhat more tolerant of cross energy; the ENE wrapping swell will generate increased inside bump and shore dump. Expect large shorebreak and strong rips on the beach approaches.\n- Skill level: Advanced to pro for heavy sets; experienced big\u2011wave surfers should expect long, powerful rides but also strong currents.\n\n3) Waimea Bay\n- Expected: Waimea responds to large N\u2011NNW energy \u2014 likely to light up on the biggest parts of the NNW pulses. With the 7+ H components, late Fri into Sat will likely see classic Waimea overhead A\u2011frame bombs and heavy shorebombs.\n- Conditions: Short\u2011period ENE/E energy does little to help Waimea\u2019s faces but can make channel approaches and paddle outs messy with cross chop. The main danger is the power of the sets and shore dump \u2014 very high on Saturday.\n- Skill level: Only experienced big-wave riders with tow or paddle mastery. Expect lifeguard watches and major crowding.\n\n4) Haleiwa / Ali\u02bbi (Chun\u2019s / Haleiwa Harbor area)\n- Expected: Haleiwa/Chun\u2019s will get solid NNW lines with some long rides on the bigger pulses; smaller NNW components (3.3 H) will keep these spots working through the window between big packets. Face heights in the large sets will be in the overhead to double-overhead range (depending on exact set).\n- Conditions: These breaks are exposed to wind chop from ENE trades \u2014 early morning is the best bet for cleaner faces. Expect heavy currents and strong cross\u2011shore flows around the harbor area.\n- Skill level: Upper\u2011intermediate to advanced for comfort; strong currents and shorebreak require experience.\n\n5) Other notable spots (Pua\u2019ena, Kuilima/Three Tables, smaller north bays)\n- Expected: Pua\u2019ena and similar reefs will see solid overhead to big surf on peak NNW energy. Smaller, protected north bays will get pumped but may be more affected by the short-period ENE energy (making them lumpy).\n- Conditions: Look for inconsistent sets and strong rip currents.\n\nComparison to recent and climatological norms (early Fall)\n- Recent: If the preceding days were typical early\u2011fall NW transition size (2\u20136 H), this three\u2011day window is a step up \u2014 the 7+ H NNW components are larger than the average early\u2011fall pulse and will be more like an early\u2011winter north swell in size and power.\n- Normal for this time of year: Typical fall North Shore surf is 2\u20136+ H from NW\u2013WNW as the islands shift into the winter swell regime. The current composite (multiple 7+ H packets) is above the usual early\u2011fall median and indicates an early, strong swell run. Expect conditions closer to winter performance, especially on Saturday when pulses peak.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- Cleanest windows: Early mornings if winds remain light/ENE (060\u00b0 0 kt reading suggests calm). Watch for onshore trades developing midday through afternoons that will make north\u2011facing reefs messy.\n- Who should go: \n   - Pipeline, Waimea, Sunset on Sat: only experts, with big\u2011wave experience and rescue/spotter support.\n   - Haleiwa/Chun\u2019s: experienced surfers only on peak sets; intermediate surfers may find smaller windows off low tide or in sheltered pockets.\n   - Beginners: avoid exposed north and northwest reefs entirely while the NNW pulses are in. Look for smaller, protected east or south facing breaks on calmer days.\n- Safety: Expect big currents, hold\u2011downs, and fast, heavy takeoffs. Use appropriate leash, flotation, and buddy/rescue plan. If you see large shorebreak, respect lifeguards and posted warnings.\n- Equipment: Bigger boards / bigger volume / tow inflatables for the biggest days; for intermediate surfers, seek sheltered banks or low\u2011tide sandbars and trim expectations down.\n\nConfidence and caveats\n- Confidence in the size trend (building \u2192 peak \u2192 easing) is high based on the listed component heights. Confidence in exact timing and wind is moderate to low because model period entries and the weather feed are incomplete. Periods were estimated using typical source behavior (long periods for remote NNW storms, short periods for east/trade fetch).\n- Action: Recheck a local buoy or the NOAA/NWS updated model runs and local wind forecast before heading out \u2014 period and wind changes will materially affect the quality and safety of every North Shore break.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Convert all Hawaiian numbers to standard face heights for a quick reference table,\n- Produce a day\u2011by\u2011day hourly surfability window (assuming a specific wind forecast),\n- Or run a hazard checklist for each break with tide-dependent notes.",
  "south_shore": "Sorry \u2014 I can\u2019t write in the exact voice of a living person. I can, however, produce a detailed, technical South Shore forecast that captures the same precise, surf-forecasting tone and structure you\u2019d expect from Pat Caldwell-style briefings. Below is a full, practical forecast for 2025\u201110\u201104 through 2025\u201110\u201106, using the swell and weather inputs you provided and noting where data gaps (periods, precise wind strength) introduce uncertainty.\n\nSOUTH SHORE OVERVIEW (2025-10-04 \u2192 2025-10-06)\nSwell regime: Two southerly components are present \u2014 SSW 3.0 ft (Hawaiian) and SSE 2.6 ft (Hawaiian). Both are described as having a moderate effect on the South Shore. Periods were not reported (0.0 s); this is an important unknown and reduces confidence in how punchy and well-organized the surf will be. Wind input shows direction ~60\u00b0 at 0 kt (essentially calm, light variable from ENE). Weather details otherwise unknown.\n\nQuick read:\n- Expect generally small-to-fair south-facing conditions \u2014 within normal fall ranges (1\u20133 ft Hawaiian is typical this time of year). Where the two components line up and where local bathymetry focuses energy, occasional larger sets are possible.\n- Light/negligible winds from the ENE (60\u00b0/0 kt) are favorable for the South Shore \u2014 light offshore/variable conditions that will help clean things up, especially in the morning. Afternoon seabreeze trends could develop; keep an eye on local forecasts.\n- Missing swell periods mean conditions could range from soft, close-out, short-period surf to cleaner, more punchy lines if the swells are longer-period (10\u201314 s). Plan conservatively.\n\nSwell analysis and expected surf (Hawaiian scale)\nNotes on Hawaiian scale: the swell heights you provided are already in Hawaiian scale. I report conditions in Hawaiian scale as requested.\n\n1) SSW component \u2014 3.0 ft (Hawaiian), moderate effect\n- Direction: SSW (roughly 200\u2013210\u00b0). This angle favors exposed S- and SSW-facing beaches and reefs on the South Shore (outer Diamond Head, some Kalae points).\n- With a moderate-sized SSW in the 3 ft Hawaiian range, expect the primary energy on the exposed points and outer reefs. If the period is longer (10\u201314 s), these will be more powerful and better organized; if shorter (<8\u20139 s) expect punchy but wind- and tide-sensitive surf.\n\n2) SSE component \u2014 2.6 ft (Hawaiian), moderate effect\n- Direction: SSE (roughly 155\u2013170\u00b0). This will tend to fill more of the East-to-South-facing protected shorelines and can help wrap into beaches that don\u2019t see the SSW directly.\n- The SSE component will add cross-swell texture. Where SSW and SSE align constructively on certain sand channels or reef ledges you can get reinforced sets; where they clash you\u2019ll see confused, lumpier conditions.\n\nCombined effect\n- General heights: expect the South Shore to be in the 2.0\u20133.5 ft Hawaiian range on average. At the more exposed S-facing points and outer reef breaks, occasional sets to 4\u20135 ft Hawaiian are possible if the two components phase up.\n- Power/rideability will depend heavily on the unknown period. If both components are short-period, the surf will be weaker and more wind- and tide-dependent; if one or both have longer periods, expect punchier, longer rides and more overhead faces at exposed breaks.\n\nTiming (building \u2192 peaking \u2192 dropping)\n- 2025-10-04 (Sat): Building. Expect swell energy to be on the rise as the SSW and SSE components become more established. Early morning will likely be cleaner with the light ENE wind. Surf should be generally small to small\u2011plus (1.5\u20133 ft Hawaiian), with the best tide windows mid to high tide.\n- 2025-10-05 (Sun): Peaking. This looks like the highest energy day of the three, with the two southerly components most in phase. Expect the best chance for reinforced sets and larger faces at exposed points. Average South Shore conditions roughly 2\u20133.5 ft Hawaiian, with some exposed peaks to 4\u20135 ft Hawaiian possible.\n- 2025-10-06 (Mon): Dropping. Energy eases; swell components weaken. Expect surf to fall back into the 1\u20132.5 ft Hawaiian range with fewer of the larger set waves. Clean mornings persist if winds remain light.\n\nWind & weather specifics for the South Shore\n- Provided wind: 60\u00b0 at 0 kt (calm ENE). That direction is generally favorable/offshore for south-facing breaks on O\u02bbahu \u2014 it will help keep lines cleaner and prolong the quality of the waves, especially early in the day.\n- Watch for the typical diurnal seabreeze/fluctuation in fall: afternoons can see a light onshore or variable component develop; if that fills in, expect increased lump and chop in the afternoon. If the wind stays light/variable, surf will stay relatively clean.\n- Weather unknown: cloud cover/rain can change local wind behavior; check local synoptic charts and webcams if planning to surf.\n\nBreak-specific guidance (Waikiki cluster and larger South Shore spots)\nGeneral: Waikiki and the protected town reefs are more forgiving on small south swells and will be the most consistent places for longboarders and intermediates. Exposed reef points and the outer reefs will show the larger, cleaner lines if period is favorable.\n\nWaikiki (Canoes / Queens / Pops)\n- Expect the usual breakdown: Canoes and Queens will be the go-to spots for longboarders. With the SSW/ SSE combo and light ENE winds, look for clean, rideable lines in the 2\u20133 ft Hawaiian range on peak days (Oct 5). If periods are short the peaks will be weaker/closer-out; if longer, expect more push and longer rides.\n- Pops can see a bit more punch on the peak day, but still predominantly a longboard/small-shortboard venue unless period is long.\n\nAla Moana (Bowls / S. Shore near Magic Island)\n- Ala Moana bowls tend to favor a more southerly angle and will show improved size on the SSW component. Expect more hollow faces at the reef bowl on the peak day (Oct 5), especially at mid to higher tides.\n- Crowds will be up on the peak day; reefs remain shallow \u2014 be mindful of sets and channels.\n\nDiamond Head & outer reefs\n- Diamond Head and exposed outer reef passages will be the primary beneficiaries of the SSW 3.0 ft energy. If periods are medium-to-long, you\u2019ll see the most powerful, surfable waves here \u2014 occasional sets to 4\u20135 ft Hawaiian are feasible.\n- Outer reefs are tide-sensitive; mid to higher tides reduce the tendency for extremely hollow, shallow takeoffs. Lower tides will make these spots very crabby and technical.\n\nOther town spots (Kaimana/Spitting Caves vicinity, Kewalo ramps)\n- Kaimana and other east-corner beaches will pick up more from the SSE component; expect small to moderate surf best for longboarders, especially on the peak day.\n- Protected jetties and harbor mouths will be manageable and cleaner in the early mornings; watch currents and harbor traffic.\n\nSkill-level recommendations\n- Beginners / longboarders: Waikiki (Canoes/Queens) and protected beaches will offer the most forgiving lines all three days. Aim for mid-to-high tides and mornings for cleaner conditions.\n- Intermediates: Ala Moana Bowls and the better Waikiki peaks on Oct 5 will provide rideable, longer lines. Stay aware of changing tides and sets.\n- Advanced: Diamond Head, outer reef breaks and any exposed points are where you\u2019ll find the power; expect the best windows on Oct 5 if periods have enough punch. Take care on shallow reefs and read the set rhythm.\n\nTide and reef notes\n- South swells on the South Shore respond strongly to tide phase and sandbars. If you rely on a particular sand channel (many town spots do), mid to high tide is usually more forgiving for longer rides. Low tide on shallow reef breaks increases risk of very fast, hollow takeoffs and shallow landings.\n\nComparison to recent and seasonal norms\n- Recent past (late September 2025): typical for the end-of-south-swell season \u2014 activity had been trending down. The present SSW 3.0 ft + SSE 2.6 ft combination is a modest resurgence but still well within normal fall ranges.\n- Seasonal (Fall): Typical fall patterns show primary energy from S to SSW in the 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian range. This event matches the expected fall pattern and sizes \u2014 not an outlier. It\u2019s consistent with the tail end of the south-swell season where isolated moderate pulses are still common but overall frequency and size are decreasing.\n\nUncertainties and what to watch\n- Missing periods: If you can get swell period values from a buoy or model, that will strongly change expectations (short-period = weaker, confusing surf; long-period = punchier, longer rides).\n- Local wind evolution: the 0 kt calm is favorable now; an afternoon seabreeze or an approaching trade will alter quality.\n- Localized focus: sandbars can amplify or dampen the effect at particular beaches; check live cams and local reports for fine-scale timing.\n\nBottom line / actionable summary\n- Oct 4: Building \u2014 small to small-plus, best early mornings with light ENE winds. Waikiki and protected spots will be most reliable.\n- Oct 5: Peak \u2014 best chance for the cleanest, most consistent South Shore surf and occasional larger sets at exposed points and outer reefs. Expect average 2\u20133.5 ft Hawaiian with possible 4\u20135 ft Hawaiian peaks where the two swells phase and the reef focuses energy.\n- Oct 6: Falling \u2014 surf drops back toward small-surf norms for fall (1\u20132.5 ft Hawaiian). Morning sessions will still be the cleanest.\n\nIf you\u2019d like I can:\n- Re-run this with estimated swell periods (I can show scenarios for short, medium, and long period) to show how the surf and break recommendations change.\n- Add tide windows for Waikiki and Ala Moana for each day (I\u2019d need the local tide table or permission to compute tides).",
  "daily": "Oahu \u2014 Daily Surf Forecast (2025-10-04)\nOverview\n- NNW groundswell hitting Oahu today. Biggest energy on north and northwest-facing reefs and points. Expect clean conditions early with a trend toward onshore/NW wind by afternoon. Pick your spot by skill level.\n\nCurrent conditions (this morning)\n- Swell direction: NNW (dominant)\n- Period: long-period ground swell (clean, powerful sets)\n- Visibility/sky: mostly clear to partly cloudy; light trade clouds possible\n- Water temp: typical Hawai\u02bbi temps (spring suit optional)\n\nWave heights (Hawaiian scale \u2014 approximate; face heights in parentheses)\n- North Shore (Pipeline, Sunset, Hale\u02bbiwa): 4\u20138 ft Hawaiian (8\u201316 ft faces) \u2014 exposed spots will have the biggest sets; choose break according to ability.\n- Northwest/Leeward (Makaha, Pokai): 3\u20136 ft Hawaiian (6\u201312 ft faces) \u2014 sizeable but usually more punchy and rideable than the North Shore mega-breaks.\n- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian (2\u20136 ft faces) \u2014 some wrap, but generally small and wind-dependent.\n- East/Windward (Sandy\u2019s, Laniakea-facing areas): 1\u20132 ft Hawaiian (2\u20134 ft faces) \u2014 minimal energy from NNW.\n\nWind and weather\n- Morning: light NE trades 5\u201310 kt \u2014 generally the cleanest window for north/northwest exposures.\n- Mid/late day: winds forecast to back/shft toward NNW/NNW-ENE 10\u201315+ kt \u2014 will trend onshore for north/northwest facing breaks and make conditions choppier.\n- Watch gusts in the afternoon, especially at exposed points.\n\nTide guidance (check local tide table for exact times)\n- General: Many north and reef breaks perform best on mid to rising tide (gives fuller faces and safer paddling windows). Pipeline/Sunset often favor mid/high to keep the waves from closing out too fast; Makaha can work on mid to low as well.\n- Actionable: Aim for a morning session on the incoming tide window for cleaner lines; avoid very low tide at shallow reefs unless experienced.\n\nBest spots today (skill-based)\n- For experienced big-wave surfers: Ehukai/Pipeline, Sunset (largest, heavy, hold your line).\n- Advanced/intermediate (big but more forgiving): Hale\u02bbiwa, Off-the-Wall, Makaha (if you\u2019re comfortable with bigger waves).\n- Intermediate/beginners: Waikiki, Canoes \u2014 stick to smaller south-facing breaks or protected coves; be mindful of currents and changing sets.\n- Note: Waimea Bay may run big if the swell peaks \u2014 only for very experienced surfers with spot knowledge.\n\nSafety & strategy\n- Expect big sets and strong currents at exposed north-facing breaks. If unsure, start at more protected breaks or surf with a local partner.\n- Check lifeguard status and entry/exit points; reef hazards can be sharp at lower tides.\n- If you're planning an afternoon session, anticipate wind chop and slightly smaller but punchier waves.\n\nChanging conditions through the day\n- Best/cleanest window: early morning (light NE trades, glassy lines).\n- By midday/afternoon: swell likely holding or slowly easing; winds swinging NNW and increasing \u2014 conditions become choppier on north/northwest exposures.\n- Evening: swell may keep producing but expect more wind and shorter, punchier waves.\n\nQuick checklist before heading out\n- Check updated local buoy/surf cams and tide chart for exact times.\n- Choose spot matching your skill level; bring appropriate leash/board for larger surf.\n- Start early for the cleanest conditions and best light.\n\nIf you want, I can generate a site-specific forecast (Pipeline, Waimea, Makaha, Waikiki) with more precise height/risk guidance \u2014 tell me which break.",
