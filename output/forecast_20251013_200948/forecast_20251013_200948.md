### Summary
Dominant swell: a long-period NW/NW–NNW groundswell. Buoy spectral snapshots show an active NW field tonight (H1/3 ≈ 6.9–8.**2 ft**, **15–17 s**; H1/10 set faces roughly **9–11 ft**). Physics-based propagation predicts a pronounced Aleutian pulse arriving Tue 10/14 (~14:32 HST, ~**8 ft** @ 20 s deep-water) with a follow-up pulse Wed 10/15 (~10:42 HST, ~**6 ft** @ 18 s). Local winds are light ENE trades (~080° at 5 kt per PHNL METAR), favoring cleaner north-facing conditions in the swell windows. Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0.

### Details
- NW / NNW long-period field — present and reinforcing: Spectral reads in the digest list multiple NW vectors (321°, 326°, 315°, 313°) with periods **15–17 s** and H1/3 6.9–8.**2 ft** (H1/10 est 9.0–10.**7 ft**). Time stamps in the swell matrix show energy present on Mon 10/13 ~19:20 HST (source: buoy; digest does not provide buoy IDs). Significance values cluster 0.63–0.75, indicating robust open-ocean generation but some uncertainty in directional exposure to individual Oahu breaks.
- Aleutian pulses (physics arrivals): Propagation modeling flags an **8 ft** @ 20 s arrival Tue 10/14 14:32 HST (confidence ~75%) and a **6 ft** @ 18 s arrival Wed 10/15 10:42 HST. These arrivals align with the large north‑central Pacific low noted in the pressure analysis (deep, broad fetch favorable for long-period NW swell). Expect the Tue pulse to carry the most energy and the Wed pulse to reinforce or prolong elevated surf.
- WNW component: A 6.**9 ft** @ 16 s WNW vector (303°) in the matrix will add west-facing wrap, improving size at NW→W reef points. Arrival window is concurrent with the NW field on 10/13–10/14.
- Shorter-period/other components: Local trade windswell and small NE/N components are minor (H1/3 2.6–3.**6 ft** at ~**9–17 s**). Southern energy is weak (S 2.**3 ft** @ 13 s) and not a factor for south-facing breaks this cycle.
- Data gaps/buoy refs: The digest identifies buoy spectral sources generically (12/13 buoys successful) but does not supply station IDs for the wave spectra. Tide station is NOAA 1612340 (latest obs 1.**01 ft** at 20:00 HST). METAR PHNL 08005KT referenced for winds. Where I cite "buoy" the digest did not include numeric IDs — that constraint reduces site-specific confidence; cross-check NDBC buoys and Wavewatch III for breakpoint verification.

NORTH SHORE (Oahu)
- What to expect: Clean, long-period NW swell building into Tue 10/14 afternoon and staying elevated through Wed 10/15. Peak deep‑water H1/3 from combined fields ~**7–9 ft** (matrix + physics), translating to H1/10 set faces in the neighborhood of **9–12 ft** at exposed headland and outer-reef points (SwellCaldWell H1/10-ish estimate). Larger north-facing reef and point breaks (e.g., Haleiwa-type exposures) will see the most power and rippable long-period sets.
- Winds & tide: Trades light ENE (~5 kt) favor cleaner north exposures; late-day seabreeze may increase onshore texture. Tidal state is small — current observations near **1 ft**; high/low times in digest are dated to 10/12 so consult local tide table for session planning. Confidence medium-high for arrival timing (0.7), slightly lower for exact set faces due to unspecified buoy IDs.
- Hazards: Long-period sets will increase current strength and hold. If the Tue 20 s pulse materializes as modeled, expect longer intervals and stronger hold-downs than typical trade swell; exercise caution on outside reefs and channel areas.

SOUTH SHORE (Oahu)
- What to expect: South-facing exposures remain small through Wed 10/15. Digest shows an S component 2.**3 ft** @ 13 s (H1/10 est ~3.**0 ft**) — background and seasonally waning. No significant S/SSW arrival is expected inside the 10/13–10/15 window.
- Longer-term note: Satellite and pressure analysis flagged a southern frontal band that could generate S/SSW energy later in the week (4–8 day range). Monitor model runs; current 3‑day horizon keeps the south shore largely small and surfable for groveling boards.
- Winds & tide: Trades produce choppy windward/east exposures; south-facing spots sheltered from easterly trades will remain the most consistent small-fun options. Confidence medium given low S-significance in matrix.

OUTLOOK (beyond 10/15)
- 10/16–10/18: Continued NW influence. Physics and synoptic analysis project additional NW/NNW arrivals mid‑to‑late week from the Aleutian/north‑central storm track — modeling shows pulses arriving 10/17 (multiple **13–14 s** pulses, and an Aleutian-related 14 s energy arrival on 10/17–10/18). Expect persistent north‑to‑northwest groundswell with variable peaks into the weekend. Confidence moderate (0.65–0.75) — dependent on storm evolution and ridge shielding.
- Tropical cue: The chart flagged a compact tropical/ex‑tropical center near ~30N 160W (≈993–996 mb on the chart) with max wind ~60 kt in the analysis. Current official NHC/CPHC outlook indicates no tropical cyclone formation expected in the next 7 days. If that compact system persists/westers, it could add steeper, shorter-period energy sooner (2–4 days) — but as of this digest that threat is low. Monitor JTWC/NHC bulletins.
- Operational recommendation: Re-check NDBC buoys and Wavewatch III spectral outputs 12–24 hours before key sessions (Tue midday and Wed morning windows). Watch PHFO/OPC surface forecasts for changes in fetch orientation; small shifts in storm latitude will materially change exposure and set face estimates for Oahu.

Closing line (house style)
Short version — robust long-period NW groundswell on the timeline: expect building north‑to‑northwest surf Tue into Wed with the largest pulse ~Tue afternoon (10/14) and reinforcement Wed (10/15). Trades light now; clean conditions likely at the best north/northwest exposures. Data-quality caveat: buoy station IDs for the spectral snapshots are not included in the digest (sources labeled generically as "buoy"); verify with live NDBC buoy reads and model spectra for break‑level planning.

## North Shore Forecast

North Shore — dominant pulse: NW 8.**2 ft** (H1/3) with an H1/10 roughly 10.**7 ft**, arriving in the late-evening window around 2025-10-13 19:20 HST and holding/peaking into Tuesday as additional long-period NW energy fills in.

Why we trust it (brief): buoy network picked up multiple consistent NW/NNW long-period swells (8.**2 ft** @ 15s, 7.**5 ft** @ 17s, support from 6.9–7.**5 ft** bands) and the highest-exposure weights sit on the primary NW pulses (0.96–0.98). That buoy signal plus the Aleutian storm propagation timing points to a clear late-Monday into Tuesday peak, then a secondary reinforcement Wednesday morning (see physics arrivals below). Overall confidence: medium (0.69) — good raw data but some uncertainty in exact peak timing and local wind development.

Wind / tide interplay (short, practical):
- Current obs show light E winds (~080° at 5 kt) — that’s generally favorable/offshore for the north-facing reefs and will help clean the faces through the first daylight periods. If the trades kick back up from the ESE/ENE later, expect a bit of texture but still manageable for experienced surfers.
- Long-period NW energy like this builds steep, powerful lines across the outer reefs. Mid to higher tides usually smooth and lengthen the walls at Sunset and Pipeline; very low tides will expose reef and make barrels punchier and more hazardous. Waimea prefers bigger water — higher tides reduce the danger of hitting reef/runup rocks on monster sets.
- Bottom line: light easterly winds + rising tide windows will give the best shaped, hollower barrels. Low tide + onshore wind (if trades strengthen) = unpredictable, punchy closeouts and dangerous wash-throughs.

Flagship breaks — expected faces & conditions (be conservative; local variations apply)
- Pipeline / Ehukai (Banzai) — Expect very hollow, heavy barrels. With H1/10 ~**11 ft** arriving on long periods, sets will push well into the overhead-to-double-overhead range on the outer reef; the best barrels likely on mid-high tides. This is serious surf: only experienced barrel riders and spot teams.
- Sunset Beach — Long, powerful walls with big push; plenty of long-period energy for long rides and heavy closeouts on the biggest sets. Mid to high tide will smooth the takeoffs; low tide increases odds of wipeout/punch-through onto shallow reef.
- Waimea — Will respond to this pulse with large, fast-running waves on sets. Peak runs usually require the bigger sets and some tide; expect high consequences in a paddle/big-wave context (tow and experienced big-wave crews recommended).
- Haleiwa / North Shore points — Rippable, fast surf when the angle leans a bit more WNW; expect strong currents in the approaches and heavy shoreward runoff on the banked sections.

Hazards (explicit):
- These numbers are in the range that commonly triggers local high-surf concerns at the most exposed North Shore reefs. Expect strong rip currents, wash-throughs, and hazardous shorebreaks — waves here will carry a lot of energy and can push well above the deep-water H1/10 when they hit shallow reef.
- Only strong, experienced surfers (and boat/tow crews at Waimea-scale surf) should consider paddling; bystanders and small craft should keep distance. Local advisories could be posted as the pulse peaks — monitor county/NOAA statements.

Short physics-based note (how this plays out through the 3-day window):
- Primary Aleutian pulse already observed on buoys (8.**2 ft** @ 15s) — timing centered late Mon 10/13 into Tue 10/14. Buoy and exposure weights indicate a broad, coherent arrival across the exposed North Shore fetch (high confidence on the fact of arrival).
- Reinforcement expected Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday from a second Aleutian pulse (forecast arrival Wed 10/15 ~10:42 HST, ~**6 ft** @ 18s) — this will sustain elevated north swell into mid-week even as the first pulse starts to decay. Exact amplitude and peak timing have moderate uncertainty (winds, shorter-period windsea contamination, and local bathymetric focusing are variables).

Confidence and caveats:
- Data coverage is good (buoys 12/13, charts/satellite/tides all reporting); global confidence 0.69 — moderate. High confidence that a significant NW long-period swell is arriving late 10/13 and peaking into 10/14. Medium confidence on the exact peak hour(s) and how wind shifts and tide phasing will shape each individual break — small changes in wind or tide can flip a clean, barrel day into a messy, dangerous closeout session.

If you want, I can:
- Break this down into hourly tide/wind windows for each spot, or
- Flag expected best surfing windows by daypart (AM/PM) for Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore forecast — Tue Oct 13 → Thu Oct 15, 2025

Opening assessment (size, direction, timing)
- Primary driver for the south-facing beaches over the next 72 hours is a small, local S-swell: S 2.**3 ft** H1/3 (≈ 3.**0 ft** H1/10) at ~13 s. The analysis shows that energy centered around 19:30 HST on Oct 13 is the main southerly contributor and then steadily weakens through Oct 14–15. This is a residual fall south swell — within the season’s typical **1–3 ft (Hawaiian)** range.
- Big North/NW groundswell energy is present in the dataset (multiple NW pulses, long periods **15–20 s**) and will be dominant on the north shore. There is limited potential for very long-period NW energy to diffract/wrap into exposed southeast pockets late Oct 13–14, but any wrap will be small and inconsistent relative to the direct S-swell — expect mostly southerly signatures on the south shore with occasional cross/bumps from northern energy.

Daily breakdown and practical numbers
- Tue Oct 13: S 2.**3 ft** H1/3 (~3.**0 ft** H1/10) at 13 s — small but rideable: waist-to-chest high faces at the most exposed south-facing reefs. Winds light E ~5 kt (PHNL obs 08005KT), so expect generally clean early-morning conditions with some onshore texture during the day.
- Wed Oct 14: Southerly energy fades — H1/3 trending down toward ~1.5–2.**0 ft**, H1/10 proportionally smaller. NW long-period fetches (Aleutian arrivals) increase in the North Pacific; wrapping into southeast-facing nooks may add confusing, long-period lumps late in the day but not a sustained southerly increase.
- Thu Oct 15: South swell largely spent — most spots will be small and inconsistent (around **1 ft** H1/3 or less). Short, isolated sets possible at the most sheltered reef corners on mid to high tide; expect cleaner mornings with light winds.

Town vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head)
- Ala Moana: Best of the “town” spots this window. Protected geometry means the small S-swell will hold up here better than exposed beaches. Expect manageable, soft gutless waves good for longboarders and SUPs. Mid-to-higher tides will smooth the takeoff; low tide can make the inside shorebreak punchy and choppy.
- Waikiki (Queens, Canoes, Pops): Smooth, runnable longboard lines likely through Oct 14 as the S-swell fills the bay. Canoes/Queens will be the most consistent in small conditions. Light E winds will add slight onshore texture but are below the threshold to ruin early-morning sessions.
- Diamond Head: When the S-swell is present this spot can produce longer right-hand runs — on these small 13-s lines expect mellow, drawn-out rides for longboarders. If any long-period NW wraps in late Oct 13–14 it can make the peak glassy but a little inconsistent; strong wraps are unlikely.

Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd & consistency expectations
- Longboards/soft-tops: Primary winners. The 13 s, small S-swell and protected town reefs will favor longboard-style paddlers and beginners. Expect the most consistent rides at Canoes, Queens, and Ala Moana.
- Shortboards: Marginal. Shortboard performance will be limited to the few punchier inside peaks at Ala Moana or an occasional steeper section at Diamond Head on mid-low tide. Overall wave energy and steepness are low for high-performance maneuvers.
- Crowd: Small to moderate. When conditions are small and clean, longboarders and SUP users will dominate lineups. Expect local regulars at Ala Moana and Waikiki early in the morning; fewer surfers on the water later in the day as onshore texture increases.

Wrap potential and background southern-hemisphere pulses
- Background: Fall is the tail end of the south swell season; the dataset shows only a modest S-pulse (2.**3 ft** @13 s) — no new southern hemi storm trains are queued in the central Pacific outlook.
- Wrap: The stronger signal in the charts/ buoys is NW/N long-period energy. Physically, **15–20 s** NW energy can diffract around Oahu’s northern tip and produce low-frequency, long-period lumps in southeast-facing pockets. Expect occasional, widely-spaced long-period sets that may confuse the small southerly pattern late Oct 13–14, but don’t expect sustained south-facing big surf from those sources. In short: minor, intermittent wrap possible, not a reliable swell change for the south shore.

Winds & tides — quick operational notes
- Observed wind: PHNL 08005KT at 19:53 HST (E 5 kt). Forecast window expects light E–ENE trades ~5–10 kt — best windows in the early morning when winds are lightest.
- Tides: Recent NOAA station reading ~1.**01 ft** (latest obs 20:00 HST). South shore benefits from mid-to-higher tides for fuller, cleaner takeoffs on reefs; low tide can expose reef and tighten, hollower waves — that may favor shortboard-savvy riders but raises risk for beginners.

Confidence & data completeness
- Confidence: medium (0.69/1.00). The briefing is backed by strong station and chart coverage (buoys 12/13, charts 3/3, METARs and satellite present). That gives good situational awareness for the south shore signal, but uncertainty remains about how much of the strong NW long-period energy will refract into southeast nooks — that’s the primary source of variability in this forecast.

Bottom line
- Expect small, rideable south shore surf Tue–Wed (best for longboards and SUPs), fading through Thu. Light early-morning winds will offer the cleanest windows. Watch for occasional long-period lumps late Oct 13–14 from NW wrap — they’ll be sporadic and likely only change texture rather than produce a sustained increase.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: Big NW groundswell running — North Shore is firing and raw; only experienced surfers at exposed spots, others stick to protected breaks or small south/easts.

NORTH SHORE: Powerful long-period NW (315–335°) energy — expect **8–11 ft** faces with occasional bigger sets (**15–17 s** periods); best window: now through the evening (prime late afternoon → sunset) as tide moderates; heavy, fast sets — reef and point breaks will close out.

SOUTH SHORE: Small and clean — S energy ~**2–3 ft** @ ~13 s (knee–chest); fun at protected south reefs and beaches on low–mid tide but not worth driving for big waves.

EAST / WEST — quick hits:
- EAST: Small NE/E short-period energy (~**3–4 ft** @ ~10 s); protected east coves may be rideable and clean.
- WEST: WNW wrap gives occasional lump and speed at west-facing points; expect some punch but wind-exposed.

WINDS: Surface winds 080° at ~5 kt — light east winds. That’s essentially cross-off/clean for north- and west-facing breaks and onshore for sheltered south-facing beaches; the light trades should keep faces relatively clean through the afternoon. Confidence: medium.

### Tides:
- Latest obs: ~1.**01 ft** (20:00 HST, 10/13).
- Recent extremes (NOAA 1612340): recent high ≈ 2.**2 ft** (10/12 morning), recent low ≈ 0.**21 ft** (10/12 midnight).
Practical note: tide is around mid-level this evening — many reef breaks will hold best on mid→low.

ACTION ITEM: If you’re experienced and comfortable in big, hollow North Shore surf — go now through sunset but respect currents, large sets and hold-down risk; inexperienced surfers should avoid exposed north points and opt for protected east coves or small south reefs. Watch for a larger Aleutian swell building into Tuesday afternoon (Oct 14)—conditions will ramp up.
