Buoy spectral snapshots show an active NW field tonight (H1/3 \u2248 6.9\u20138.2 ft, 15\u201317 s; H1/10 set faces roughly 9\u201311 ft). Physics-based propagation predicts a pronounced Aleutian pulse arriving Tue 10/14 (~14:32 HST, ~8 ft @ 20 s deep-water) with a follow-up pulse Wed 10/15 (~10:42 HST, ~6 ft @ 18 s). Local winds are light ENE trades (~080\u00b0 at 5 kt per PHNL METAR), favoring cleaner north-facing conditions in the swell windows. Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0.\n\nDETAILS\n- NW / NNW long-period field \u2014 present and reinforcing: Spectral reads in the digest list multiple NW vectors (321\u00b0, 326\u00b0, 315\u00b0, 313\u00b0) with periods 15\u201317 s and H1/3 6.9\u20138.2 ft (H1/10 est 9.0\u201310.7 ft). Time stamps in the swell matrix show energy present on Mon 10/13 ~19:20 HST (source: buoy; digest does not provide buoy IDs). Significance values cluster 0.63\u20130.75, indicating robust open-ocean generation but some uncertainty in directional exposure to individual Oahu breaks.\n- Aleutian pulses (physics arrivals): Propagation modeling flags an 8 ft @ 20 s arrival Tue 10/14 14:32 HST (confidence ~75%) and a 6 ft @ 18 s arrival Wed 10/15 10:42 HST. These arrivals align with the large north\u2011central Pacific low noted in the pressure analysis (deep, broad fetch favorable for long-period NW swell). Expect the Tue pulse to carry the most energy and the Wed pulse to reinforce or prolong elevated surf.\n- WNW component: A 6.9 ft @ 16 s WNW vector (303\u00b0) in the matrix will add west-facing wrap, improving size at NW\u2192W reef points. Arrival window is concurrent with the NW field on 10/13\u201310/14.\n- Shorter-period/other components: Local trade windswell and small NE/N components are minor (H1/3 2.6\u20133.6 ft at ~9\u201317 s). Southern energy is weak (S 2.3 ft @ 13 s) and not a factor for south-facing breaks this cycle.\n- Data gaps/buoy refs: The digest identifies buoy spectral sources generically (12/13 buoys successful) but does not supply station IDs for the wave spectra. Tide station is NOAA 1612340 (latest obs 1.01 ft at 20:00 HST). METAR PHNL 08005KT referenced for winds. Where I cite \"buoy\" the digest did not include numeric IDs \u2014 that constraint reduces site-specific confidence; cross-check NDBC buoys and Wavewatch III for breakpoint verification.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- What to expect: Clean, long-period NW swell building into Tue 10/14 afternoon and staying elevated through Wed 10/15. Peak deep\u2011water H1/3 from combined fields ~7\u20139 ft (matrix + physics), translating to H1/10 set faces in the neighborhood of 9\u201312 ft at exposed headland and outer-reef points (SwellCaldWell H1/10-ish estimate). Larger north-facing reef and point breaks (e.g., Haleiwa-type exposures) will see the most power and rippable long-period sets.\n- Winds & tide: Trades light ENE (~5 kt) favor cleaner north exposures; late-day seabreeze may increase onshore texture. Tidal state is small \u2014 current observations near 1 ft; high/low times in digest are dated to 10/12 so consult local tide table for session planning. Confidence medium-high for arrival timing (0.7), slightly lower for exact set faces due to unspecified buoy IDs.\n- Hazards: Long-period sets will increase current strength and hold. If the Tue 20 s pulse materializes as modeled, expect longer intervals and stronger hold-downs than typical trade swell; exercise caution on outside reefs and channel areas.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- What to expect: South-facing exposures remain small through Wed 10/15. Digest shows an S component 2.3 ft @ 13 s (H1/10 est ~3.0 ft) \u2014 background and seasonally waning. No significant S/SSW arrival is expected inside the 10/13\u201310/15 window.\n- Longer-term note: Satellite and pressure analysis flagged a southern frontal band that could generate S/SSW energy later in the week (4\u20138 day range). Monitor model runs; current 3\u2011day horizon keeps the south shore largely small and surfable for groveling boards.\n- Winds & tide: Trades produce choppy windward/east exposures; south-facing spots sheltered from easterly trades will remain the most consistent small-fun options. Confidence medium given low S-significance in matrix.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 10/15)\n- 10/16\u201310/18: Continued NW influence. Physics and synoptic analysis project additional NW/NNW arrivals mid\u2011to\u2011late week from the Aleutian/north\u2011central storm track \u2014 modeling shows pulses arriving 10/17 (multiple 13\u201314 s pulses, and an Aleutian-related 14 s energy arrival on 10/17\u201310/18). Expect persistent north\u2011to\u2011northwest groundswell with variable peaks into the weekend. Confidence moderate (0.65\u20130.75) \u2014 dependent on storm evolution and ridge shielding.\n- Tropical cue: The chart flagged a compact tropical/ex\u2011tropical center near ~30N 160W (\u2248993\u2013996 mb on the chart) with max wind ~60 kt in the analysis. Current official NHC/CPHC outlook indicates no tropical cyclone formation expected in the next 7 days. If that compact system persists/westers, it could add steeper, shorter-period energy sooner (2\u20134 days) \u2014 but as of this digest that threat is low. Monitor JTWC/NHC bulletins.\n- Operational recommendation: Re-check NDBC buoys and Wavewatch III spectral outputs 12\u201324 hours before key sessions (Tue midday and Wed morning windows). Watch PHFO/OPC surface forecasts for changes in fetch orientation; small shifts in storm latitude will materially change exposure and set face estimates for Oahu.\n\nClosing line (house style)\nShort version \u2014 robust long-period NW groundswell on the timeline: expect building north\u2011to\u2011northwest surf Tue into Wed with the largest pulse ~Tue afternoon (10/14) and reinforcement Wed (10/15). Trades light now; clean conditions likely at the best north/northwest exposures. Data-quality caveat: buoy station IDs for the spectral snapshots are not included in the digest (sources labeled generically as \"buoy\"); verify with live NDBC buoy reads and model spectra for break\u2011level planning.\n\n\u2014 Pat \"SwellCaldWell\" Caldwell, Surf News Network",
  "north_shore": "North Shore \u2014 dominant pulse: NW 8.2 ft (H1/3) with an H1/10 roughly 10.7 ft, arriving in the late-evening window around 2025-10-13 19:20 HST and holding/peaking into Tuesday as additional long-period NW energy fills in.\n\nWhy we trust it (brief): buoy network picked up multiple consistent NW/NNW long-period swells (8.2 ft @ 15s, 7.5 ft @ 17s, support from 6.9\u20137.5 ft bands) and the highest-exposure weights sit on the primary NW pulses (0.96\u20130.98). That buoy signal plus the Aleutian storm propagation timing points to a clear late-Monday into Tuesday peak, then a secondary reinforcement Wednesday morning (see physics arrivals below). Overall confidence: medium (0.69) \u2014 good raw data but some uncertainty in exact peak timing and local wind development.\n\nWind / tide interplay (short, practical):\n- Current obs show light E winds (~080\u00b0 at 5 kt) \u2014 that\u2019s generally favorable/offshore for the north-facing reefs and will help clean the faces through the first daylight periods. If the trades kick back up from the ESE/ENE later, expect a bit of texture but still manageable for experienced surfers.\n- Long-period NW energy like this builds steep, powerful lines across the outer reefs. Mid to higher tides usually smooth and lengthen the walls at Sunset and Pipeline; very low tides will expose reef and make barrels punchier and more hazardous. Waimea prefers bigger water \u2014 higher tides reduce the danger of hitting reef/runup rocks on monster sets.\n- Bottom line: light easterly winds + rising tide windows will give the best shaped, hollower barrels. Low tide + onshore wind (if trades strengthen) = unpredictable, punchy closeouts and dangerous wash-throughs.\n\nFlagship breaks \u2014 expected faces & conditions (be conservative; local variations apply)\n- Pipeline / Ehukai (Banzai) \u2014 Expect very hollow, heavy barrels. With H1/10 ~11 ft arriving on long periods, sets will push well into the overhead-to-double-overhead range on the outer reef; the best barrels likely on mid-high tides. This is serious surf: only experienced barrel riders and spot teams.\n- Sunset Beach \u2014 Long, powerful walls with big push; plenty of long-period energy for long rides and heavy closeouts on the biggest sets. Mid to high tide will smooth the takeoffs; low tide increases odds of wipeout/punch-through onto shallow reef.\n- Waimea \u2014 Will respond to this pulse with large, fast-running waves on sets. Peak runs usually require the bigger sets and some tide; expect high consequences in a paddle/big-wave context (tow and experienced big-wave crews recommended).\n- Haleiwa / North Shore points \u2014 Rippable, fast surf when the angle leans a bit more WNW; expect strong currents in the approaches and heavy shoreward runoff on the banked sections.\n\nHazards (explicit):\n- These numbers are in the range that commonly triggers local high-surf concerns at the most exposed North Shore reefs. Expect strong rip currents, wash-throughs, and hazardous shorebreaks \u2014 waves here will carry a lot of energy and can push well above the deep-water H1/10 when they hit shallow reef.\n- Only strong, experienced surfers (and boat/tow crews at Waimea-scale surf) should consider paddling; bystanders and small craft should keep distance. Local advisories could be posted as the pulse peaks \u2014 monitor county/NOAA statements.\n\nShort physics-based note (how this plays out through the 3-day window):\n- Primary Aleutian pulse already observed on buoys (8.2 ft @ 15s) \u2014 timing centered late Mon 10/13 into Tue 10/14. Buoy and exposure weights indicate a broad, coherent arrival across the exposed North Shore fetch (high confidence on the fact of arrival).\n- Reinforcement expected Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday from a second Aleutian pulse (forecast arrival Wed 10/15 ~10:42 HST, ~6 ft @ 18s) \u2014 this will sustain elevated north swell into mid-week even as the first pulse starts to decay. Exact amplitude and peak timing have moderate uncertainty (winds, shorter-period windsea contamination, and local bathymetric focusing are variables).\n\nConfidence and caveats:\n- Data coverage is good (buoys 12/13, charts/satellite/tides all reporting); global confidence 0.69 \u2014 moderate. High confidence that a significant NW long-period swell is arriving late 10/13 and peaking into 10/14. Medium confidence on the exact peak hour(s) and how wind shifts and tide phasing will shape each individual break \u2014 small changes in wind or tide can flip a clean, barrel day into a messy, dangerous closeout session.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Break this down into hourly tide/wind windows for each spot, or\n- Flag expected best surfing windows by daypart (AM/PM) for Pipeline, Sunset and Waimea.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast \u2014 Tue Oct 13 \u2192 Thu Oct 15, 2025\n\nOpening assessment (size, direction, timing)\n- Primary driver for the south-facing beaches over the next 72 hours is a small, local S-swell: S 2.3 ft H1/3 (\u2248 3.0 ft H1/10) at ~13 s. The analysis shows that energy centered around 19:30 HST on Oct 13 is the main southerly contributor and then steadily weakens through Oct 14\u201315. This is a residual fall south swell \u2014 within the season\u2019s typical 1\u20133 ft (Hawaiian) range.\n- Big North/NW groundswell energy is present in the dataset (multiple NW pulses, long periods 15\u201320 s) and will be dominant on the north shore. There is limited potential for very long-period NW energy to diffract/wrap into exposed southeast pockets late Oct 13\u201314, but any wrap will be small and inconsistent relative to the direct S-swell \u2014 expect mostly southerly signatures on the south shore with occasional cross/bumps from northern energy.\n\nDaily breakdown and practical numbers\n- Tue Oct 13: S 2.3 ft H1/3 (~3.0 ft H1/10) at 13 s \u2014 small but rideable: waist-to-chest high faces at the most exposed south-facing reefs. Winds light E ~5 kt (PHNL obs 08005KT), so expect generally clean early-morning conditions with some onshore texture during the day.\n- Wed Oct 14: Southerly energy fades \u2014 H1/3 trending down toward ~1.5\u20132.0 ft, H1/10 proportionally smaller. NW long-period fetches (Aleutian arrivals) increase in the North Pacific; wrapping into southeast-facing nooks may add confusing, long-period lumps late in the day but not a sustained southerly increase.\n- Thu Oct 15: South swell largely spent \u2014 most spots will be small and inconsistent (around 1 ft H1/3 or less). Short, isolated sets possible at the most sheltered reef corners on mid to high tide; expect cleaner mornings with light winds.\n\nTown vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head)\n- Ala Moana: Best of the \u201ctown\u201d spots this window. Protected geometry means the small S-swell will hold up here better than exposed beaches. Expect manageable, soft gutless waves good for longboarders and SUPs. Mid-to-higher tides will smooth the takeoff; low tide can make the inside shorebreak punchy and choppy.\n- Waikiki (Queens, Canoes, Pops): Smooth, runnable longboard lines likely through Oct 14 as the S-swell fills the bay. Canoes/Queens will be the most consistent in small conditions. Light E winds will add slight onshore texture but are below the threshold to ruin early-morning sessions.\n- Diamond Head: When the S-swell is present this spot can produce longer right-hand runs \u2014 on these small 13-s lines expect mellow, drawn-out rides for longboarders. If any long-period NW wraps in late Oct 13\u201314 it can make the peak glassy but a little inconsistent; strong wraps are unlikely.\n\nLongboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd & consistency expectations\n- Longboards/soft-tops: Primary winners. The 13 s, small S-swell and protected town reefs will favor longboard-style paddlers and beginners. Expect the most consistent rides at Canoes, Queens, and Ala Moana.\n- Shortboards: Marginal. Shortboard performance will be limited to the few punchier inside peaks at Ala Moana or an occasional steeper section at Diamond Head on mid-low tide. Overall wave energy and steepness are low for high-performance maneuvers.\n- Crowd: Small to moderate. When conditions are small and clean, longboarders and SUP users will dominate lineups. Expect local regulars at Ala Moana and Waikiki early in the morning; fewer surfers on the water later in the day as onshore texture increases.\n\nWrap potential and background southern-hemisphere pulses\n- Background: Fall is the tail end of the south swell season; the dataset shows only a modest S-pulse (2.3 ft @13 s) \u2014 no new southern hemi storm trains are queued in the central Pacific outlook.\n- Wrap: The stronger signal in the charts/ buoys is NW/N long-period energy. Physically, 15\u201320 s NW energy can diffract around Oahu\u2019s northern tip and produce low-frequency, long-period lumps in southeast-facing pockets. Expect occasional, widely-spaced long-period sets that may confuse the small southerly pattern late Oct 13\u201314, but don\u2019t expect sustained south-facing big surf from those sources. In short: minor, intermittent wrap possible, not a reliable swell change for the south shore.\n\nWinds & tides \u2014 quick operational notes\n- Observed wind: PHNL 08005KT at 19:53 HST (E 5 kt). Forecast window expects light E\u2013ENE trades ~5\u201310 kt \u2014 best windows in the early morning when winds are lightest.\n- Tides: Recent NOAA station reading ~1.01 ft (latest obs 20:00 HST). South shore benefits from mid-to-higher tides for fuller, cleaner takeoffs on reefs; low tide can expose reef and tighten, hollower waves \u2014 that may favor shortboard-savvy riders but raises risk for beginners.\n\nConfidence & data completeness\n- Confidence: medium (0.69/1.00). The briefing is backed by strong station and chart coverage (buoys 12/13, charts 3/3, METARs and satellite present). That gives good situational awareness for the south shore signal, but uncertainty remains about how much of the strong NW long-period energy will refract into southeast nooks \u2014 that\u2019s the primary source of variability in this forecast.\n\nBottom line\n- Expect small, rideable south shore surf Tue\u2013Wed (best for longboards and SUPs), fading through Thu. Light early-morning winds will offer the cleanest windows. Watch for occasional long-period lumps late Oct 13\u201314 from NW wrap \u2014 they\u2019ll be sporadic and likely only change texture rather than produce a sustained increase.",
  "daily": "HEADLINE: Big NW groundswell running \u2014 North Shore is firing and raw; only experienced surfers at exposed spots, others stick to protected breaks or small south/easts.\n\nNORTH SHORE: Powerful long-period NW (315\u2013335\u00b0) energy \u2014 expect 8\u201311 ft faces with occasional bigger sets (15\u201317 s periods); best window: now through the evening (prime late afternoon \u2192 sunset) as tide moderates; heavy, fast sets \u2014 reef and point breaks will close out.\n\nSOUTH SHORE: Small and clean \u2014 S energy ~2\u20133 ft @ ~13 s (knee\u2013chest); fun at protected south reefs and beaches on low\u2013mid tide but not worth driving for big waves.\n\nEAST / WEST \u2014 quick hits:\n- EAST: Small NE/E short-period energy (~3\u20134 ft @ ~10 s); protected east coves may be rideable and clean.\n- WEST: WNW wrap gives occasional lump and speed at west-facing points; expect some punch but wind-exposed.\n\nWINDS: Surface winds 080\u00b0 at ~5 kt \u2014 light east winds. That\u2019s essentially cross-off/clean for north- and west-facing breaks and onshore for sheltered south-facing beaches; the light trades should keep faces relatively clean through the afternoon.
