  "main_forecast": "SUMMARY\nA concentrated NNW/N pulse arrives late Oct 6 UTC (early HST) \u2014 multiple NNW components (largest 8.2 ft @13s) combine with shorter N and NW energy to lift the North Shore through Oct 6\u20137. Peak North Shore energy early Oct 7 HST with raw, powerful sets. South Shore remains small through Oct 6\u20138 \u2014 only a weak SSE/southerly component (~1.6 ft @13s) in the window; larger tropical south swell remains a later/monitor issue. Typical fall trade pattern and the large subtropical high will favor variable ENE\u2013E winds that will affect surf quality (cross/onshore for south exposures, cleaner windows for select north-facing coves in the morning).\n\nDETAILS\n- Primary NNW package (NNW ~330\u00b0): 8.2 ft Hawaiian @ 13 s \u2014 arrival/peak 2025-10-06T19:20Z (08:20 HST Oct 6). Secondary NNW pulses: 5.6 ft @12 s (arrive/peak 2025-10-06T18:56Z / 08:56 HST), 6.9 ft @12 s (19:20Z / 08:20 HST), plus a 4.6 ft @11 s pulse (19:26Z / 08:26 HST). Together these create a broad NNW energy band with dominant periods 11\u201313 s early on.\n- Supporting N / NW energy (N ~350\u00b0 and NW ~305\u00b0): N 7.2 ft @10 s (19:20Z / 08:20 HST) and N 4.3 ft @12 s (19:26Z / 08:26 HST), NW 3.3 ft @10 s (19:30Z / 08:30 HST). These add short-period punch and closeout sets to the main NNW pulse.\n- Short SSE/southerly component (SSE ~155\u00b0): 1.6 ft @13 s (19:30Z / 08:30 HST) \u2014 negligible for big south-exposed reefs during this window; produces only small, clean longboardable sets where background south wrap exists.\n- Timing summary: initial rise begins in the early HST morning of Oct 6 as the earliest pulses arrive (08:00\u201309:00 HST). Peak energy for the combined NNW/N field should be through Oct 6 afternoon into Oct 7 morning HST, with a decay trend by Oct 8 HST but energy remaining elevated on exposed north reefs.\n- Winds & weather: regional charts and satellite show a strong subtropical high and active trade corridor. Local wind vectors are predominately ENE\u2013E (observed vector 110\u00b0 indicates an ESE component near the islands at the time of the report); expect cross\u2011onshore to onshore tendencies for south and east exposures and side\u2011offshore to offshore in protected north\u2011facing coves early. Temperature ~27\u00b0C. Low tide noted near 2025-10-06T06:54Z UTC (0.02 ft) \u2014 negligible tidal amplification, but reef breaks will respond to the usual mid\u2011tide windows for optimum shape.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Size: Expect widespread exposed North Shore reefs to push into the 8\u201312 ft Hawaiian-scale face range at the height of the pulse, with select open-reef beacons (Pipeline, Sunset, Off\u2011the\u2011Wall) seeing occasional 12\u201315 ft faces on the largest sets during peak energy (highest risk / biggest conditions during Oct 6\u20137 HST).\n- Period & direction: Dominant energy 11\u201313 s from NNW (~330\u00b0) with shorter N/NW admixture (10\u201312 s). Long-period follow-up from more northerly dateline occlusions is indicated in the charts (14\u201316 s) and may refresh energy after the first pulse.\n- Timing: rise starting Oct 6 early HST (08:00\u201309:00), peak late Oct 6 into Oct 7 morning HST, gradual falloff through Oct 8 HST but still elevated on exposed reefs.\n- Quality: early-morning windows (lightest wind) will offer the cleanest conditions at sheltered north-facing coves; exposed points will be raw with strong cross/chop from trade influence. Expect heavy shorebreak, fast closeouts and strong rips at reef passes \u2014 currents and backwash will be significant on the peak sets.\n- Specifics: Pipeline/Sunset \u2014 consistent, powerful sets at peak; Sunset and Off\u2011the\u2011Wall will see the longest, heaviest rides and the most serious shorebreak when tide and set timing combine. Haleiwa/Velzyland will be large and more punchy but slightly more protected depending on local wind; Waimea can run very large on biggest intervals with strong shore break and dangerous currents. Makaha (west) may see wrap but will be more affected by local wind and will be less clean than prime north reef points.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Size: Small \u2014 expect 1\u20133 ft Hawaiian-scale faces on the best south/southeast reefs and points. The provided SSE 1.6 ft @13 s pulse is too small to produce widespread big-surf on the south side through Oct 6\u20138.\n- Period & direction: SSE/ESE energy around 13 s (bearing ~155\u00b0\u2013160\u00b0) \u2014 long-period but low amplitude in this window. The satellite/pressure analysis flags tropical Hyalang/Octave farther south that could produce stronger south energy later; not significant through Oct 8.\n- Timing & quality: small but relatively clean conditions in early mornings where trades relax or where trades are side-offshore. However, the ENE\u2013E/SE wind component (observed 110\u00b0) will create cross\u2011onshore texture for many south exposures during the day, producing choppy conditions and diminishing quality.\n- Specifics: Waikiki/Ala Moana \u2014 expect small increased longboardable rides early, but limited peak sets. Diamond Head and east\u2011facing reef points will see modest long-period pulses but not large surf this period.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond Oct 08)\n- Short term (next 48\u201372 hrs): The combined NNW/N pulse will decay through Oct 8 HST but long-period energy and residual swell will keep exposed north reefs elevated for another 24\u201348 hours after the primary peak.\n- Mid-range (day 4\u20137): Pressure charts show an ongoing dateline gale/occlusion complex and a developing mid\u2011latitude gale \u2014 watch for a follow-up longer-period NW\u2013NNW pulse (14\u201318 s) that can re-elevate the North Shore later in the week with larger, longer-period surf if the fetch tightens and tracks east. Confidence moderate (0.6\u20130.8) for continued NW activity.\n- Tropicals: Typhoon Halong / TS Octave are being monitored \u2014 if Halong tracks west-northwest and holds intensity it will produce a more significant southerly swell (longer-period ESE/SSE energy) later than Oct 8; this would flip the best conditions to south/southeast exposures and increase hazards from squalls and strong longshore currents. Current window (Oct 6\u20138) does not yet show significant tropical south surf for Oahu.\n- Hazards and wind: expect strong currents, large shorebreak and hazardous conditions at exposed north reefs during the peak; squally convective bands associated with tropical activity may produce sudden wind shifts and rain once the tropical fetch starts to influence local conditions. Monitor local wind updates \u2014 an observed wind bearing ~110\u00b0 (ESE) will tend to foul south exposures and add texture to the north in the afternoons.\n\nOverall confidence: moderate (\u22480.7). If you want arrival/peak times listed only in HST for specific spots (Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa, Waimea, Ala Moana, Diamond Head) I can convert the UTC timestamps above into spot-specific face ranges and exact HST windows.",
  "north_shore": "I can\u2019t exactly reproduce Pat Caldwell\u2019s voice, but here\u2019s a detailed, technical North Shore surf forecast written in a similar data\u2011driven, practical style.\n\nOverview (Oct 6 \u2192 Oct 8)\n- Primary energy: a cluster of N to NNW groundswells arriving from roughly 340\u00b0\u2013350\u00b0 (NNW to N). Periods are mostly in the 10\u201313s band with one short-period NE component. Multiple moderate swells are overlaying each other \u2014 expect a moderately active North Shore with some punchy sets and intermittent lump from cross\u2011directions.\n- Hawaiian scale sizes provided below match the swell inputs you gave. Expect most exposed reef passes to feel more powerful than the raw Hawaiian numbers imply because of refracting lines and overlapping energy.\n- Wind is reported from 110\u00b0 (ESE). Speed was not provided \u2014 that matters a lot. At light\u2013moderate speeds ESE will give a side\u2011offshore component for the north shore and will clean up faces. If it\u2019s strong ESE/SE it will push a sideshore texture and can create lumps and sand movement near shore. Check local cams/buoys for current wind speed before paddling.\n\nSwell breakdown (sources, direction, period, Hawaiian scale)\n- NNW 8.2 ft @ 13 s \u2014 primary energy maker for exposed NNW facing reef; best generator of longer, punchier sets.\n- NNW 6.9 ft @ 12 s and NNW 5.6 ft @ 12 s \u2014 reinforce the 13s line, keep swell train steady and extend the window of usable surf.\n- N 7.2 ft @ 10 s and N 4.3 ft @ 12 s \u2014 add north component, filling in exposures that favor a slightly more northerly angle.\n- NNW 4.6 ft @ 11 s and NW 3.3 ft @ 10 s \u2014 smaller supporting lines that will add texture to the lineup and keep the shoulder active.\n- NE 6.6 ft @ 7 s \u2014 short\u2011period, more local/nearshore swell; will rough up the inside, produce chop and push onshore energy into shallow reef zones (can ruin glassy faces at some spots).\n\nTiming and evolution\n- Oct 6 (Day 1): Conditions build through the day. Expect surf to be already measurable in the morning from the earlier NNW pulses, with the stronger 13s line continuing to organize into the afternoon. Evening should show a steady increase in interval and select larger sets as the 13s energy better grounds into the reef.\n- Oct 7 (Day 2): Peak window. The 13s 8.2 ft line should be near its strongest this day, reinforced by the 12s pulses. Morning into mid\u2011day will likely show the best defined sets and most power. By late afternoon the big lines begin to overlap and the lineup can go from clean to a little confused as different directions converge.\n- Oct 8 (Day 3): Gradual decline. Most longer-period energy eases; shorter-period N and NE components and residual 11\u201312s lines remain. Surf size will drop from the peak but pockets of punchy sets will persist on the most exposed reefs.\n\nWind/weather effects (north shore specifics)\n- Wind direction 110\u00b0 (ESE): For the north shore this carries a southerly component that is slightly offshore (offshore = from land toward the water on the north shore). That orientation tends to groom faces at the exposed points and create cleaner conditions, particularly in the morning when trades are typically lighter. ESE is a good angle for hollow barrelling at Pipeline and Sunset when not too strong.\n- Caveat: If the 110\u00b0 wind is strong (trade/wind speeds 15+ kt), expect sideshore gusts, increased spray and some surface texture \u2014 barrels will be harder to find and the lineup can get blown out. If winds back toward NE or E the north shore will still be reasonably clean; if winds rotate south or southwest the offshores will shift onshore and make conditions messy.\n- NE 7s short-period swell will produce nearshore lump and short, punchy sets \u2014 this energy can make shoulder lines inconsistent and create tricky closeouts at shallower reef exits.\n\nBreak\u2011specific expectations and practical advice\nNote on Hawaiian sizing vernacular used here: I list the swells in the Hawaiian scale you supplied and then give practical shot\u2011list interpretation for each break.\n\nPipeline / Ehukai (Banzai Reef)\n- Expected size: Mix of the 8.2 ft @13s and 6.9\u20135.6 ft @12s will focus on Pipeline\u2019s NNW entrance tags. Hawaiian 8\u20136 ft energy with 12\u201313s period \u2014 this is enough to produce solid, hollow barrels on prime sections.\n- Best window: Peak morning to early afternoon on Oct 7. Cleanest if ESE winds stay moderate or light.\n- Tide interplay: Low\u2013mid tide favors the classic heavy Pipeline sections; too high and the lip will dump faster but can still close out.\n- Skill level: Not for intermediates at these sizes. Expect fast takeoffs, thick lips and heavy re\u2011entries. Hold the exit line \u2014 currents and backwash from overlapping swells can pin surfers on the inside.\n- Practical: Use a performance shortboard at the shoulder/hollow sections; bigger swallow or step\u2011ups will be needed if the sets jack up. Watch the channel for confusing rips and set surge.\n\nSunset Beach\n- Expected size: Responsive to the 13s/12s NNW energy \u2014 Hawaiian 6\u20138 ft pulses should deliver long, hollowed walls and pitty barrels on the peak sections, especially during the peak on Oct 7.\n- Best window: Mid\u2011tide to high\u2011mid on peak day will keep long walls; morning light with ESE breeze will clean faces.\n- Skill level: Advanced recommended in bigger sets. Produces long rides if you can make the drop and get the rail in.\n- Practical: Sunset can hold power even as period drops \u2014 expect strong shorebreak and little forgiveness near the inside. Keep a leash and chest protection if you\u2019re going big.\n\nWaimea Bay\n- Expected size: With most energy in the 10\u201313s band, Waimea will see solid surf but not classic XXL Waimea unless a longer period (16\u201320s) pulse hits. The 7.2 ft @10s and 8.2 ft @13s will give Waimea push \u2014 expect Hawaiian 6\u20138 ft sets on the peak but less sustained than a deep\u2011ocean storm swell.\n- Best window: Peak mid\u2011day Oct 7 as the 13s arrives. Needs a bit of tide and direction to fully flesh out.\n- Skill level: Big wave capable paddlers and tow teams should be comfortable in this range; smaller boards may struggle on the bigger sets. If you\u2019re local and big\u2011water experienced, it\u2019s runnable; otherwise stay back and spectate.\n- Practical: Currents and channel flow on the inside will be strong with overlapping swells. If you paddle it, check crew and safety plan.\n\nHaleiwa / Rocky Point / Chun\u2019s\n- Expected size: Exposed points like Haleiwa and Rocky Point will see the 12\u201313s energy translate into overhead to well\u2011overhead conditions on sets \u2014 Hawaiian 6\u20138 ft pulses. Rocky Point will get more refracted, longer walls; Chun\u2019s will see punchier, shorter rides.\n- Best window: Morning through midday Oct 7. With ESE winds these points can be clean and offer great face shape.\n- Skill level: Intermediate+ at the smaller sets; advanced on bigger pulses.\n- Practical: These spots will pick up wind chop faster into the afternoon if winds increase. Keep an eye on shore breaks and shallow inside rocks.\n\nPupukea (back bays, off\u2011peak areas)\n- Expected size: Backing lee and inside revs will be smaller \u2014 the reef lines closer to shore will feel the NE 7s short swell more, producing choppy, punchy waves and confusing closeouts. Hawaiian 3\u20135 ft in protected pockets while exposed reefs still see larger lines.\n- Practical: Good options for intermediates if you want smaller, more manageable waves \u2014 but expect turbulence and mixed directions.\n\nGeneral surf safety and equipment notes\n- Multiple directions = confused seas. When several swells overlap (NNW + N + short NE), expect sets that refract and jack quickly \u2014 more shorebreak, unpredictable channels and stronger rips.\n- Board sizes: Bring a step\u2011up or a board with a little extra volume for the main NNW sets (8\u20139\u2019 gun for very large days at Waimea/Pipeline if that\u2019s your zone) or a solid hybrid/shortboard 6\u20190\u20136\u20196 for Sunset/Haleiwa depending on your skill. For smaller reef breaks, a standard shortboard will do.\n- Leashes and reef booties: Highly recommended. Reef is shallow in many takeoff zones and backwash can slam you into rock.\n- Newer surfers: Avoid exposed pipeline, Sunset and Waimea at these sizes. Look for protected sandier breaks or smaller back bays.\n\nComparison to normal for this time of year (early October, fall)\n- Typical fall pattern on the North Shore runs NW\u2013WWN swells 2\u20136+ ft (Hawaiian) as the system transitions into winter. Early fall usually has an uptick in NW energy as storms form in the North Pacific but typically not the full winter size or long-period swells yet.\n- How this event compares: This multi-line N/NNW event fits the early\u2011season trend but is a bit more active than a baseline day \u2014 several moderate 10\u201313s lines stacked together produce a fuller, more punchy North Shore than the \u201caverage\u201d early October day. Not extreme compared to true winter giants, but above the typical calm early\u2011fall session; surfable and substantial on exposed reef passes.\n\nUncertainties / what to watch\n- Wind speed: 110\u00b0 is favorable for cleaning faces if it stays light\u2013moderate. If it ramps up (15+ kt), expect blown out conditions and more cross chop.\n- Local tide swings and sand movement: Small shifts can change peak shape quickly on shallow reefs \u2014 check the tide chart for preferred windows at Pipeline/Sunset (low\u2013mid for Pipeline, mid for Sunset).\n- If a longer-period (16\u201318s) pulse appears upstream, Waimea and the most exposed points could jack further. Conversely, if the 13s line weakens earlier than modeled, the peak will be shorter.\n\nBottom line (concise)\n- Expect an active North Shore run Oct 6\u20138 with the best surf on Oct 7 when the 13s NNW energy peaks. ESE winds (110\u00b0) will likely produce a useful offshore component \u2014 favors clean, hollow conditions at Pipeline and Sunset if winds remain light. Overlapping short\u2011period NE energy will add lump and shore texture, so conditions can go from glassy to confused as sets stack. Veterans and big\u2011wave capable surfers will find solid, powerful conditions; less experienced surfers should seek protected spots or sit this one out.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Convert the Hawaiian scale numbers to approximate face heights for each break,\n- Add a tide\u2011specific timing window if you give the tide times,\n- Pull in local buoy/wind speeds to refine the wind impact.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore \u2014 O\u02bbahu\nForecast period: 2025-10-06 through 2025-10-08\nOverview (short)\n- Primary energy: SSE swell, 1.6 ft (Hawaiian), 13 s period \u2014 small, but with decent period for its size so it will produce usable faces across the town spots.\n- Local wind reported from 110\u00b0 (ESE). Wind speed not available \u2014 small-swell performance will be very sensitive to whether that wind is light or breezy. See wind notes below.\n- Tide/timing: smaller, longer-period south swells like this generally perform best on mid to higher tides at the town breaks. Expect small, clean longboard-style lines if winds are light; if winds are onshore/moderate, expect bumpy, pushy closes.\n\nSwell analysis\n- Height: 1.6 ft (Hawaiian). Quick conversion: Hawaiian scale is commonly about half the face height; 1.6 ft Hawaiian corresponds roughly to 3\u20134 ft faces on sets (typical local translation). Expect average faces roughly in the 2\u20134 ft range, with the occasional slightly bigger set if the buoy readings under-sampled the peak.\n- Period: 13 s \u2014 moderate period. Not a long-period storm swell, but long enough to organize into rideable lines rather than short, mushy lumps. Sets will be more punchy and better formed than a 7\u20139 s sea.\n- Direction: SSE. Typical fall direction is generally S to SSW; this one is a bit more easterly (SSE) than the classic S\u2013SSW fall swells. That shifts energy slightly toward breaks that face more southeast (parts of Waikiki and some of the eastern town points) and away from spots that prefer SSW.\n\nWind and weather effects (South Shore specifics)\n- Wind direction 110\u00b0 (ESE): For much of the South Shore coastline an ESE wind often reads as side-shore to slight offshore in protected pockets (Waikiki Canoes and some spots near the reef) but can be cross-shore to onshore at fully south-facing points. Here\u2019s how to think about it:\n  - If winds are light (<10 kt): ESE will generally be forgiving \u2014 small swell + decent period = clean, groomed lines across Waikiki and Ala Moana. Longboard lines and gentle peelers likely.\n  - If winds are moderate to fresh (10\u201320+ kt): expect surface texture, with cross-shore chop and some push at exposed points (Ala Moana outer bowl and Kewalo). Small waves will become harder to ride; sets less organized and more closing out.\n  - Afternoon sea-breezes and local thermal effects can swing winds a bit more E to SE and increase onshore influence into the afternoon; mornings are typically the cleanest window if winds are building.\n- Weather-related caveat: With wind-speed unavailable, plan for two scenarios (light vs moderate). If you value efficiency, check a local wind source before heading out.\n\nTiming (building / peaking / dropping)\n- 10/06 (Mon): Swell is present and should be near its peak energy for this small SSE pulse. Morning window likely best if winds are light. Expect the most frequent, rideable sets through the day; slight easing possible late evening.\n- 10/07 (Tue): Holding or slowly easing. Still surfable at town spots, but average set size trends down compared to the 10/06 peak. Morning again the cleaner window; late afternoon risk of increased onshore sea-breeze.\n- 10/08 (Wed): Gradual drop continues. Surf becomes smaller and more inconsistent \u2014 best for longboards, SUPs, and beginners seeking more forgiving waves. By late day 10/08, conditions may be back to background southern residue.\n\nBreak-specific guidance (town spots and nearby)\nNote: \u201cHawaiian\u201d heights given first, followed by approximate face heights in feet.\n\nWaikiki \u2014 Canoes / Queens / Pops\n- Expected: 1.5\u20132.0 ft (Hawaiian) \u2014 roughly 3\u20134 ft faces on sets at peak (10/06), trimming to 1\u20131.5 ft (H) by 10/08.\n- Behavior: Canoes and the inner reef are forgiving and longboard-friendly. With a 13 s period you\u2019ll get longer, catchable lines \u2014 ideal for longboard work and noserides if winds are light. Queens and Pops will offer slightly punchier rides; Pops can hold a little more energy but will still be small and mostly friendly.\n- Best conditions: Mid to high tide; mornings if wind is light.\n\nAla Moana (Bowls / Inner Harbor)\n- Expected: 1.5\u20132.0 ft (H) on the bowl during the swell peak \u2014 chest/shoulder on experienced surfers at the bowl on better sets; smaller inside.\n- Behavior: Ala Moana outer bowl is more exposed to SSE energy and will show more of the swell\u2019s power than the inner town spots. With 13 s period the bowl can produce fun, quick walls if winds are light, but expect short, punchy rides rather than long peelers. If the wind strengthens from the ESE, the bowl becomes textured and a bit messy.\n- Best conditions: Slightly higher tides and cleaner mornings. Good choice if you want a bit more performance out of a small south.\n\nKewalo / China Walls / Sans Souci (Kaka\u02bbako)\n- Expected: 1\u20131.8 ft (H) \u2014 generally smaller than Waikiki proper; faces roughly 2\u20133.5 ft on sets.\n- Behavior: These spots are more variable\u2014wind exposure and local bathymetry make them sensitive. China Walls can see cleaner lines when wind is ESE and light, but small swell often struggles to fully organize here. Sans Souci can provide a short, fun wall on good sets.\n- Best conditions: Light ESE winds and mid-tide; otherwise these breaks can be a bit spotty on a small SSE.\n\nDiamond Head / eastern town points\n- Expected: similar to Waikiki, maybe slightly less consistent; good morning windows could provide fun shoulder-high occasional sets for longboards and small shortboards.\n- Behavior: Breaks closer to the headland will see modest SSE energy but need the tide to link up.\n\nWho should go and equipment notes\n- Longboarders, foam-boarders, and beginners: Best days of the run. Small, forgiving faces with the 13 s period make for long rides and good learning. Target Waikiki Canoes, Queens, and the inner sections of Ala Moana on mid-high tide.\n- Small-board chargers and performance shortboarders: Some usable sets at Ala Moana outer bowl and Pops if you\u2019re seeking a punchier wedgy hit, but don\u2019t expect long high-performance rides. Bring a slightly larger board than your absolute shortboard if winds trend onshore.\n- SUPs/kite: Not a focus here\u2014kayaks and SUPs will find mellow conditions at Canoes on light winds.\n\nHazards and local notes\n- Current and crowding: Town spots can get crowded even on small days; watch for cross-traffic and inexperienced paddlers. When the swell is small, the lineup can spread across sections\u2014respect priority.\n- Wind uncertainty: Because wind speed data is unavailable, plan conservatively. If you find brisk ESE winds when you arrive, conditions will be much rougher than the small-swell forecast implies.\n\nComparison to recent and normal conditions (seasonal context)\n- Seasonal norm for Fall: Typical fall South Shore runs S to SSW swells in the ~1\u20133 ft (Hawaiian) range with diminishing activity later in the season. The South Shore typically tapers as trade/ground-swell patterns shift.\n- This pulse (SSE, 1.6 ft H, 13 s) is within the normal fall size range but on the lower-to-middle side of typical fall energy. Direction is a touch more easterly than the classic S\u2013SSW fall swells, so spots that favor SSE will benefit a bit more.\n- Compared to recent days: if recent days were flat or smaller, this is a modest improvement and worth a morning check. If recent days had a larger SSW series, this will feel smaller and more east-shifted.\n\nShort wrap-up / surf plan\n- Best bet: Head out early on 10/06 for the cleanest window. Longboards and mid-lengths will get the most out of this swell. Ala Moana outer bowl and Pops will be the pick for anyone after slightly punchier short rides; Waikiki Canoes and Queens are the go-to for cruisy, forgiving lines.\n- Monitor real-time wind observations: with wind speed not supplied, the difference between a fun session and a messy one will largely be wind-dependent.\n- Expect a gradual easing from 10/06 \u2192 10/08; by the evening of 10/08 conditions will be trending toward background residual south energy.\n\nIf you want, I can generate a short 3-day hourly table (morning/afternoon/evening) with tide windows for each break and local wind scenarios (light vs moderate) to help pick exact session times.",
  "daily": "Oahu \u2014 Daily Surf Report\nDate: 2025-10-06 \u2014 Dominant swell: NNW\n\nCurrent summary (today)\n- NNW swell is the driver today: favors north- and west-facing breaks. Expect the morning to be the cleanest window with lighter winds; conditions trend windier and more chopped into the afternoon as the NNW breeze increases.\n- Suit: 3/2 or 4/3 spring (water still warm but bigger sets and windchill in the AM/PM).\n\nWave heights (Hawaiian scale)\n- North Shore (Ehukai/Pipeline, Hale\u02bbiwa, Rocky Point, Waimea): shoulder\u2013head to overhead (S\u2013H to OH). Occasional larger sets\u2014advanced-only at exposed spots.\n- West Shore (Makaha, Yokohama): chest\u2013shoulder (W\u2013C to S\u2013H). Good for longboard and powerful shortboard sessions depending on tide.\n- South Shore (Waikiki, Ala Moana): ankle\u2013knee to small waist (A\u2013K to W) \u2014 generally small and sheltered from a pure NNW.\n- East Shore (Kailua, Lanikai, Sandy Beach): largely flat to ankle (A) \u2014 east shores remain protected from NNW energy.\n\nWind & weather\n- Morning: light/variable to gentle ENE/NE trades 5\u201310 kt in many spots \u2014 best window (glassy/cross-shore conditions for north & west breaks).\n- Midday \u2192 afternoon: NNW winds build to 10\u201320+ kt, increasing chop and making exposed north/west reefs lumpier and less organized.\n- Forecast: partly cloudy with scattered showers possible. Temperatures in the low\u2013mid 80s.\n\nTide guidance (practical surfing notes)\n- General rule today: aim for the morning mid-tide window for most reef/point breaks (better shape, less tendency to close out). Low tide may expose shallow reef; high tide can soften some spots.\n- Beach breaks (Waikiki, west sandbars) often work better on higher tides \u2014 adjust session plan to local tide chart before heading out.\n- Always check the live tide chart for exact times for your chosen spot.\n\nBest spots for today (given NNW swell)\n- Advanced/powerful waves: North Shore \u2014 Ehukai/Pipeline (for heavy overhead sets), Hale\u02bbiwa and Waimea for larger, punchy waves. Only go if experienced and comfortable with reef/shorebreak.\n- Solid, more rideable NW energy: West Shore \u2014 Makaha and nearby breaks pick up the NNW cleanly and can offer long powerful rides.\n- Small/clean or longboard sessions: Early Waikiki or Ala Moana for a mellow alternative; eastside (Kailua/Lanikai) remains sheltered and small.\n- If unsure, choose lifeguarded breaks and check local surf cams/reports.\n\nHazards & tips\n- Expect strong currents, larger unexpected sets at exposed north-west spots, and shallow reef at low tide\u2014use caution.\n- Best session: early morning before NNW winds rise. If winds build, consider shifting to more protected breaks or call it a day.\n- Gear: stronger leash, board suitable for overhead (for North/West). Helmets advised in crowded or heavy reef areas.\n\nChanging conditions through the day\n- Morning: cleanest, light winds \u2014 best window for performance surfing.\n- Midday \u2192 afternoon: swell likely holds or slightly increases; NNW winds strengthen making faces choppy and closing out some peaks. Visibility of sets may improve but quality often drops.\n- Evening: winds may ease again later (check local forecast), but daylight limits sessions.\n\nQuick action checklist\n- Check local cams & NOAA tide times for your chosen spot.\n- Plan to surf early for best shape and cleaner conditions.\n- Match spot to skill level \u2014 North/West for experienced surfers, Waikiki/guarded breaks for intermediate or beginners.\n- Respect lifeguards and reef safety.\n\nIf you want, I can pull nearby live cams/tide times and recommend a specific time/spot for your skill level.",
