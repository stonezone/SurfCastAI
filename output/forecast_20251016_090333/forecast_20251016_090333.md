### Summary
Dominant swell: a strong NNW pulse (331°) — ~13.**8 ft** H1/3 (est. 17.**9 ft** H1/10) at 12 s — observed on buoys and peaking into Thu 10/16 morning (window noted at 08:20 HST). WNW–NW components (**14–15 s**) are co-arriving and will compound the train. Trades are E ~14 kt (PHNL METAR 08014KT), keeping conditions raw on exposed breaks. Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0 (data confidence 0.68).

### Details
- NNW (331° / 12 s — 13.**8 ft** H1/3): Primary signal. Buoy-sourced detection; timing window centered 2025-10-16 08:20 HST. Expect the strongest energy to load on exposed NW–NNW reefs and points. Exposure weights are unavailable in the digest; verify on NDBC buoys 46045 / 46022 and local HI buoys 51001 / 51002 for exact onset and period evolution.
- WNW (300° / 14 s — 13.**1 ft** H1/3): Medium‑long companion; arrives concurrently (08:20–08:26 HST). Adds westward angle and possible cross-seas on NW exposures. Monitor NDBC 46012 / 46028 for evolving period/energy.
- NW (321° / 15 s — 13.**1 ft** H1/3): Slightly longer-period energy sampled at ~08:26 HST — contributes punchy, longer-interval sets and larger faces at exposed points.
- NNW variants (339°–344°, 10.5–11.**2 ft** H1/3): Multiple NNW arrivals with **12–13 s** periods — will modulate the primary pulse into a multi-band swell train.
- SW (221–226° / **13–14 s** — 8.5–9.**2 ft** H1/3): Secondary southern/southwest energy noted at the same snapshot times; lower significance but can enhance sets on S–SE facing breaks and add cross-energy complexity.
- Pressure-chart context: deep 977 mb storm (NPAC_STORM_01) north of Hawaii with strong NW–WNW fetch is the principal generator (see recommended buoys 46045, 46022, 46012; local confirmation 51001/51002). Charts show tight gradients — favorable for long-period energy (pressure analysis suggests **18–22 s** at source, though current buoy detections are **12–15 s** range). Data gap: no spectral model output attached — rely on buoy spectral checks and WW3/ECMWF.

NORTH SHORE (Oahu)
- Key breaks: Sunset (Ehukai/Backdoor), Pipeline (Ehukai), Haleiwa (Pinetrees) and exposed NW points.
- Expected size/shape: Open-ocean H1/3 near **13–14 ft** (digest value) translates to H1/10 set faces roughly **17–18 ft** on the most exposed reef/pointer breaks; local refraction and bottom contours will produce zone-dependent variability — expect big, powerful reef sets and frequent double-ups.
- Winds/timing: Trades E ~14 kt (PHNL METAR 08014KT) — favors cross/side-onshore for many north-facing spots; expect chop and textured faces through daytime. Best small windows will occur when trades dip or swing NE–N briefly.
- Tides: Latest sea-level obs ~1.**39 ft**; low tide phase around previous evening — target mid- to rising-tide windows for more sculpted lines depending on the break.
- Hazards/operational: Strong currents, heavy shorebreak at shallow reefs, crowding — only experienced surfers; reef hazards and larger-than-expected sets possible because exposure weights were not provided (data gap). Monitor NDBC 46045 / HI 51001 for real-time confirmation.
- Confidence: medium (0.68) — buoy detections are solid but spectral/phasing details absent.

SOUTH SHORE (Oahu)
- Key breaks: Ala Moana, Diamond Head, south reef points.
- Expected size/shape: SW energy is secondary (8.5–9.**2 ft** H1/3 at **13–14 s**) — expect background south-swell pulses, larger on open south-facing reefs but generally much smaller than the north-side load. H1/10 set faces ~**11–12 ft** on the largest sets at exposed S breaks, but most local south shores will see chest-to-head high lines with occasional larger sets.
- Winds/timing: E trades produce bump and short-period chop on east-facing components; southern energy quality improves only with lighter winds.
- Tides: small tidal range; check local tide windows for best shape. Latest obs ~1.**39 ft** — use mid-tide windows for many south pockets.
- Hazards: Cross-seas and mixed directional energy can make takeoffs unpredictable. Data limitations: exposure weights and exact refraction losses for southerly energy not provided; expect conservative sizing until local buoys confirm.

OUTLOOK (Oct 17–20)
- Short (Oct 17–18): Expect the multi-band NW/NNW train to persist with slowly decreasing periods in the **12–15 s** band; WNW component will continue to compound rawness. Trades likely remain E ~10–16 kt — winds will control face texture and quality.
- Medium (Oct 19–20): Physics-based swell arrivals indicate additional Aleutian/Kuril pulses building late weekend:
  - Aleutian pulses: **4 ft** @ 13 s arriving Sun 10/19 ~19:37–21:55 HST (two modeled arrivals at ~13 s and ~11 s). These will boost energy on Sun evening into Mon, increasing long-period content and set size on exposed NW faces.
  - Kuril pulse: **3 ft** @ 20 s arriving Mon 10/20 ~08:33 HST — longer-period energy that can produce very large H1/10 set faces on exposed reefs (watch for a step-up in face heights, especially on Monday AM).
- Combined effect: Expect a renewed build and long-period enhancement Oct 19–20 with potential for much larger H1/10 faces (15–20+ ft at the most exposed NW reef/pointers) depending on phasing. Monitor NDBC 46045 / 46022 / 46012 and local HI buoys 51001 / 51002 and WW3/ECMWF fields for precise peaks and phasing.
- Tropical note: Central Pacific tropical outlook shows no cyclone formation next 7 days — no tropical compounding expected (CPHFO / NHC statement).

Operational notes and data limitations
- Primary buoys to watch for real‑time evolution: NDBC 46045, 46022, 46012; HI buoys 51001, 51002. METAR: PHNL 161853Z 08014KT CLR 29/20 A3005. Tide station NOAA 1612340 last obs 2025‑10‑16 08:48 HST 1.**39 ft**.
- Data gaps: exposure-weights unavailable in swell matrix; spectral model output not attached; one climatology resource failed (uh_oahu_climo). These gaps reduce timing/peak-face precision — use buoy spectra and WW3 directional output before committing to sessions.
- Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0 (medium-high). Expect robust NW swell as primary hazard and S/SW as secondary. I’ll run live buoy spectra and WW3 checks on request and tighten timing/sizing.

## North Shore Forecast

Dominant pulse: a very strong NNW pulse is in — coastal buoys are showing ~13.**8 ft** H1/3 (≈17.**9 ft** H1/10 est) at 12 s, with that energy peaking Thu morning (around 08:20 HST). Expect the NNW train to be reinforced by long-period NW/WNW energy (**13–15 s**) so lineups will see extended periods of very large, powerful sets through Thu and gradually easing into Fri–Sat.

Wind / tide interplay
- Buoy and METAR evidence point to an easterly component now (080° at ~14 kt). For the north-facing reef line this is a sideshore to slightly onshore wind — enough to add surface texture and onshore lump on exposed points and shallow reefs. If the easterlies back off toward late afternoon / overnight there will be brief windows of cleaner lines; if they persist the north fronts will be wind-rough and blown-out in places. 
- Tides will modulate how the reefs take this water. Many of the classic North Shore reefs tend to produce their heaviest, most hollow faces on mid to high ranges with this swell direction/period mix; a falling tide can also steepen closeout sections at certain hollows. Local timing will vary by break — check your tide table for exact windows. Confidence in the wind/tide interaction: medium (winds are observed but timing/sea-breeze evolution overnight has some uncertainty).

Flagship breaks — expected faces / conditions
- Pipeline (Ehukai) — Expect heavy, hollow barrels on big sets. Buoy energy (NNW 13.**8 ft** @12s; NW 13.**1 ft** @15s; exposure weights high) suggests breaking faces in the mid-teens to high teens H1/10 on routine sets with larger sets substantially bigger. East winds at ~14 kt will make portions of the lineup choppy; only seasoned locals and tow teams. Confidence: medium.
- Sunset Beach — Long-period NW/WNW energy will line up here; expect very powerful, fast-racing sets with long faces (high-teens to mid-20s H1/10 on the biggest runs estimated depending on local refraction). Best on mid–high tide windows; onshore winds will spoil some sections. Confidence: medium.
- Waimea Bay — This pulse will light Waimea. Expect big, commitment-level conditions: when the **14–15 s** components organize you'll see rideable giant faces on the biggest sets (significantly larger than the basic buoy H1/3 numbers due to local focusing). This is a spot for tow or the most experienced paddle teams only. Confidence: medium–low (local refraction/peak set timing can change runup).
- Haleʻiwa / Chuns / smaller points — Will see solid, powerful doubles-to-many-times-overhead waves depending on exact exposure; these breaks are wind-sensitive so expect variable surface texture with the current easterly component. Confidence: medium.

Hazards
- These H1/10 estimates put many exposures well into advisory/high-surf territory. Expect very strong rip currents, dangerous wash-throughs at stream mouths and reef passes, powerful shore-break/punch, and hazardous backwash. Reef impacts are severe at hollow breaks — broken boards and serious injuries are likely if you’re not experienced or not equipped for big-wave conditions. Lifeguards and authorities will likely post warnings; exercise extreme caution and do not enter the water at non-flagged, unfamiliar beaches.

Short-range additional energy (note)
- Physics-based propagation flags additional Aleutian-energy arrivals late this weekend into early next week (examples: Aleutian **4 ft** @13 s arriving Sun Oct 19 ~19:37 HST, Kuril **3 ft** @20 s arriving Mon Oct 20 ~08:33 HST). These are lower-amplitude but long-period and could prolong elevated northwesterly surf late in the 7–10 day window. Confidence on those arrivals: ~70–75% per the propagation estimates.

Confidence statement
Data coverage is good (buoy network 14/17 successful, models and charts available) and the dominant NNW/NW energy has strong buoy support; overall confidence in the broad message is moderate (global confidence 0.68). Local runup, exact peak windows at individual reefs, and the sea-breeze/onshore evolution have greater uncertainty — check the latest buoy reads, METAR updates, and local tide charts before making decisions.

Bottom line: big, powerful, and not for the casual lineup. If you’re on the shore, pick safe vantage points and expect lifeguard advisories; if you’re planning to surf, only go if you and your crew are prepared for serious big-wave conditions.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore forecast — Thu 2025-10-16 → Sat 2025-10-18
Confidence: medium (0.68). Buoys and models mostly healthy; climatology had a partial retrieval failure so expect modest uncertainty in seasonal baselines.

1) Opening assessment — size, direction, timing
- Primary energy for the South Shore arrives as two SW pulses observed on buoys: 9.**2 ft** H1/3 @ 13 s (window centered ~0800 HST 10/16) and 8.**5 ft** H1/3 @ 14 s (window ~0800 HST 10/16). Exposure weighting for the South Shore is ~0.50 in the snapshot.
- Practical/local expectation: peak on Oct 16 morning with the South Shore seeing roughly **3–5 ft** H1/3 (roughly **4–6 ft** H1/10 at the most exposed south-facing points). By Oct 17 the field drops to **2–3 ft** H1/3 (**3–4 ft** H1/10), and further eases on Oct 18 toward small, more typical late‑season south-swell heights (**1–2 ft** H1/3) as the pulses decay.
- Important caveat: there is large, longer-period NNW/WNW/NW energy present across the basin (**12–15 s**, much larger amplitudes on the north side). That energy is not a direct south swell but contributes to mixed seas and potential confused wrap/refraction patterns along the island margins.

2) Town vs outlier breaks (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head) — tides & winds
- Winds: observed METAR at 0853 HST 10/16 shows E (080°) at 14 kt. Expect persistent trade‑direction easterlies through the period, generally 10–15 kt daytime with possible light land breezes at night. That pattern favors onshore/side‑onshore texture for south-facing breaks — expect bump and chop on exposed lines.
- Diamond Head cluster:
  - Peak: Oct 16 morning. With the longer periods (**13–14 s**) Diamond Head and the headland points will see the punchiest, most organized sets — estimated **3–5 ft** H1/3 building to peak faces on sets. Falling to **2–3 ft** on Oct 17–18.
  - Tides: lower to mid tides tend to make the Diamond Head peaks punchier and hollow. On higher tides the energy winds up into fuller, slower faces.
  - Wind effect: easterlies will add surface texture; the headland geometry still concentrates energy so lines will be fuller but wind-affected.
- Waikiki (Canoes/Queens/Pops):
  - Expect lengthened, rideable sets on Oct 16 — mostly **2–4 ft** H1/3 with occasional larger sets. Waikiki’s sandbars smooth out some of the chop but persistent easterly winds will make the faces a bit bumpy.
  - Best windows: early morning in lightest winds, and during mid/late tide transitions when the sandbars set up.
- Ala Moana / Harbor & city reefs:
  - More sheltered — expect smaller, more consistent surf: roughly **2–3 ft** H1/3 on Oct 16, easing thereafter.
  - Harbor/inside breaks will be the cleanest options under the easterly flow but are also shallower and more crowded.
- Outliers (east- and SE-facing pocket reefs):
  - Some of the outlying south-facing reefs will see clean punchy peaks on the initial pulse (Oct 16), but many will be wind‑blown by the trade flow. Where the reef is backed by lee terrain, expect better shape.

3) Longboard vs shortboard suitability, crowd & consistency expectations
- Suitability:
  - Longboards: Waikiki’s longer, rideable sets will be the playground for longboarders — smooth, longer rides on the **13–14 s** energy when the sandbars cooperate. Ala Moana Harbor likewise will be longboard-friendly and cleaner under easterlies.
  - Shortboards: Diamond Head and exposed south reefs will favor shortboard maneuvers on the punchier/faster sections, especially on falling lower tides where the faces steepen.
- Consistency & crowding:
  - This is larger-than-typical late‑season south energy — expect more people than a normal October weekday, particularly at Waikiki and Diamond Head. Sets will be intermittent but well-formed on Oct 16, then less consistent but still surfable on Oct 17–18 as the swell decays.
  - Watch out for cross‑sea confusion (multiple directions) that will produce uneven sets and unpredictable peaks — that raises the number of lost takeoffs and can compress crowds onto the functioning peaks.

4) Wrap potential, southern-hemisphere background pulses, local winds — concise physics notes
- Wrap potential: The immediate south pulses are the dominant driver for the South Shore — they arrive on the expected S/SSW sector. Large NNW/WNW/NW energy is present across the basin (**12–15 s**), but wrap from robust northern directions into the true South Shore is limited; however, WNW components can refract around the west end producing some cross‑directional sets. The practical result is a mixed sea state with south‑dominant energy but interference from northerly components — expect cross‑seas and occasional confused, steep combinations.
- Southern hemisphere background: The SW **13–14 s** pulses behave like late‑season southern‑hemi energy — stronger than typical fall norms (climatology expects **1–3 ft** Hawaiian). Given the period and the buoy measurements, these are organized pulses rather than local sea noise and will produce quality rides at protected points until they decay.
- Local winds: persistent E–ESE trades (10–15 kt daytime) will be the primary shaper of surface texture. Expect cleaner conditions inside sheltered breaks and some wind chop on fully exposed headlands. Early AM low-wind windows are the best bet for cleaner faces.

Final confidence & data note
- Overall confidence medium (0.68). Buoy coverage is strong (14 of 17 successful) and models are available; however, one climatology fetch failed and directional exposure weighting has some uncertainty, so expect modest adjustments to local peak heights as nearshore transformation is refined.
- Practical takeaway: Plan for a short-lived, above‑season south pulse peaking on Oct 16 morning. Longboarders will find the most forgiving lines at Waikiki and Ala Moana; shortboarders will prefer the punchier headland peaks at Diamond Head. Keep an eye on winds — east trades will make early mornings the cleanest windows.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: Big, long-period NNW/NW energy — North Shore is running heavy and only for experienced big-wave crews; aim for morning windows and clean west-facing spots.

NORTH SHORE — Faces: N → NW (Pipeline, Sunset, Ehukai, Waimea). Direction/size: dominant NNW/NW long-period energy (**12–15s**) — raw H1/3 ~**13–14ft** (H1/10 est ~**16–18ft**). Best window: early morning into mid-morning (roughly 7:00–11:00 HST). Hazards: massive sets, powerful shorebreaks, long hold-downs, strong rips — strict big-wave discipline required.

SOUTH SHORE — Faces: S → SW (Waikiki, Ala Moana). Direction/size: only modest SW groundswell energy (~**8–9ft** @**13–14s**) undercut by dominant NNW pulse; expect inconsistent, jumbled lines. Best window: mid/ to late-afternoon if winds ease; otherwise often chopped.

EAST / WEST quick hits:
- EAST: East-facing breaks blown out by steady easterly trades (14 kt) — expect wind chop and poor conditions.
- WEST: West-facing points (Makaha) pick up WNW energy and will see cleaner, powerful surf — offshore tendency from the east wind makes them the best playable option for experienced surfers.

WINDS: METAR PHNL 08:53 — wind 080° at 14 kt (steady easterly trades). Translation: onshore/chop for east and south exposures, cross/side-shore on the North Shore (scrubbed faces), and lightly offshore for west-facing breaks (cleaner lines there). Winds likely continue through the morning at this strength.

### Tides:
- Latest observed: 1.**39 ft** at 08:48 HST (NOAA 1612340).
- Recent low: ~0.**2 ft** (19:05 HST on 10/15). Expect mid-tide this morning; watch for lower tide windows late day which can increase shorebreak and current strength.

ACTION ITEM: If you’re not an experienced big-wave surfer or crewed for heavy North Shore conditions — do not go North Shore today. Best play: experienced chargers head west (Makaha) for cleaner offshore-influenced lines in the morning; otherwise sit out or pick protected, smaller breaks later in the day when winds drop.
