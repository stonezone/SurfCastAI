### Summary
- Dominant feature: a long-period NW (310–330°) swell from a 971 mb Gulf low, forerunners due Saturday afternoon with a sharper rise near/after sunset; peak likely Sunday outside this window.
- Until then, small-moderate, mid-period NNW–NW keeps the North Shore active Thursday–Friday.
- Winds: E–ENE trades light to moderate (PHNL 070°/8 kt late Wed). Typical lighter AMs, breezier PMs. Forecast confidence: medium (0.68). Models/altimetry feeds are missing; leaning on buoy snapshots and charts.

### Details
- Long-period NW event (Gulf of Alaska):
  - Source: ~50N 148W, 971 mb storm, ENE ~20 kt with storm-force backside fetch aimed 310–340° toward HI. OPC shows 8–10+ m source seas.
  - Physics-based arrival: deepwater **5 ft** @ 18 s Saturday ~5:32 PM HST (distance ~1800 nm; 2.7 days). Expect 20 s scouts mid/late afternoon, 18 s filling evening. Nearshore H1/3 builds from **2–3 ft** midday to **4–6 ft** late, with H1/10 sets to 6–8+ ft faces at focal reefs by dusk/night.
  - Buoys: 51001 (far NE Pac) should show the bulk long before Oahu; 51101 (NW of Kauai) is the key trigger for Oahu timing of the **18–20 s** band.
- Mid-period NNW–NW mix (holding Thu–Fri):
  - Drivers: post-frontal gale ~44N 170W and a frontal wave near 31N 165W keeping **12–15 s** energy in the 300–340° sector.
  - Nearshore: H1/3 **3–4 ft** Thu, **3–5 ft** Fri, H1/10 sets **5–7 ft** faces on best exposures. Some shorter-period N windswell blends in.
  - Buoys: 51101/nearby arrays should hold mid-period energy; check for subtle reinforcement Friday.
- Trades/short-period ENE:
  - Ridge 1031–1032 mb near 33N 145–150W maintains E–ENE trades. Windward surf **2–4 ft** H1/3, **7–9 s**. Buoys 51003/51004 supportive.
- South exposures:
  - No South Pacific source recently; CPC tropical outlook quiet for 7 days. The matrix’s SW 214° **16 ft** @ 13 s print is inconsistent with season/pattern and likely a partition artifact; expect **1–2 ft** H1/3, inconsistent.

### North Shore
- Thu (10/16): NNW–NW **13–15 s**. H1/3 **3–4 ft**; H1/10 sets near **5–6 ft** faces at top exposures. Light E flow early; moderate trades PM. Fair conditions at many reefs with side/offshore bias.
- Fri (10/17): Similar or a notch up. H1/3 **3–5 ft**; sets **5–7 ft** faces. Mixed periods keep consistency decent. Manageable winds.
- Sat (10/18): AM modest **3–4 ft**. Forerunners **18–20 s** by afternoon; sharper rise late to H1/3 **4–6 ft** with H1/10 6–8+ ft faces at Sunset/Waimea/Pipeline by dusk and into the night. E–ENE trades are side/offshore; expect stronger currents with the rising long-period energy.
- Notes: Use 51001 for early heads-up and 51101 for imminent arrival. Timing/size carries medium confidence given missing model/altimetry feeds; adjust with buoy trends.

### South Shore
- Thu–Sat: Background S–SSW **12–14 s** only. H1/3 **1–2 ft**; H1/10 **2–3 ft** faces on the better magnets. Trades are side/offshore; mornings cleanest. A whisper of N wrap possible Saturday evening on select southern exposures as NW energy noses in, but minimal.

### East (Windward)
- Thu–Sat: Trade swell steady at H1/3 **2–4 ft** (**7–9 s**), choppy PM with trades, cleaner AMs. Northern Windward exposures may see extra NNW wrap Fri–Sat pushing sets to **3–5 ft** faces at times.

### Outlook
- Sun (10/19): The NW long-period swell should be the main event. H1/3 **5–8 ft** on the North Shore with H1/10 sets **8–12 ft** faces at focal reefs; still building early, leveling/peaking through the day. Trades moderate E–ENE.
- Mon (10/20): Gradual easing but still solid: H1/3 **4–6 ft**; H1/10 **6–9 ft** faces. Windward steady **2–4 ft** trades. South shore remains near-flat.
- Next potential: A pre-dateline gale near 35–40N, 170E–180 bears watching. If it reorients toward 170W with a meridional fetch, a conditional WNW (290–310°) pulse could follow mid-next week. Low confidence at this lead.

Data/Confidence notes
- Confidence medium (0.68). Altimetry, models, nearshore buoy feeds missing; relied on surface charts, CPC outlook, and available NDBC buoys (51101/51001 for NW, 51003/51004 for trades). The SW 214° 13 s “**16 ft**” buoy line is discounted as spurious given regional pattern and lack of South Pacific support.

## North Shore Forecast

Lead: A very large, long-period NNW swell (330° ±10°) dominates Thu–Fri, with deep-water H1/3 near **15–16 ft** and H1/10 near **20 ft** on the buoys (exposure weight ~0.93 for open North Shore), translating to roughly **20–30 ft** faces with occasional **30–40 ft** sets at the most exposed reefs, peaking overnight Wed–Thu, holding through Thu, and easing Fri; forerunners of the next NW pulse (about **5 ft** @ 18 s from the Gulf of Alaska) are due late Sat toward dusk.

Wind and tides: Light to moderate ENE trades early (around 070° at 5–10 kt per METAR), trending E 10–15+ kt each afternoon, gives the classic morning window: cleaner and a bit offshore for Pipe/Backdoor, more cross for Sunset, and manageable at Waimea. Afternoon onshores add bump and warble, most noticeable at wide-open exposures. Predawn lower tides with higher afternoon tides through the period favor tubes at lower water on the reefs early; the higher afternoon tide helps Waimea smooth out but can increase surges near harbor mouths. Note: local tide precision is limited from the feed; lean on on-site checks for session timing.

Flagship breaks:
- Pipeline/Backdoor (exposure strong to 330° NNW): Thu very solid **15–20 ft** faces with second-reef sets 20–25+ and intermittent first-reef closeouts; Fri easing to **10–15 ft**, still powerful; Sat morning down to **6–10 ft**, with a slight tick up late day as 18 s forerunners sneak in near dusk. Best quality early with light ENE; afternoons trend side/onshore and lumpy.
- Sunset Beach (max exposure; weight ~0.93): Thu XL **20–30 ft** faces with occasional 30–35+ bombs; strong currents and wide playing field; Fri **12–18 ft**, easing; Sat **8–12 ft** AM, holding or bumping late PM on forerunners. Mornings fair; afternoons bumpy with trades.
- Waimea Bay (likes N–NW long period): Thu **18–25 ft** faces with sets pushing **30 ft** during peak; Fri **12–18 ft**; Sat **8–12 ft** with late-day pulses possible. Higher tide helps the roll-ins; currents and surges significant even as it drops.

Buoy evidence and exposure notes:
- Primary energy is the NNW **15–16 ft** @ 15 s cluster from ~329–343° with strong North Shore exposure (weights ~0.93 for NNW, ~0.82 for NW). This aligns with the observed jump on the buoys and supports warning-level surf at the most open reefs.
- Secondary NW/WNW components (**13 ft** @ 13 s from ~300–310° and ~**7 ft** @ 13 s WNW) add cross energy but are a sideshow to the dominant NNW. Pipeline is partially shadowed from WNW, but the NNW angle opens it up and can make the first reef unruly at peak size.
- Large SW (214°) energy on the buoys is heavily shadowed for the North Shore and is not a meaningful contributor here.

Hazards: Expect high to warning-level surf on Thu for north exposures. Very strong rip and longshore currents, powerful shorebreak in exposed pockets, outer-reef wash-throughs, and harbor surges (e.g., Haleiwa) are likely during the peak. Only expert-level big-wave equipment and teams should consider outer reefs and Waimea during the max.

Outlook and timing:
- Thu (10/16): Peak of the event overnight into morning; holds high through the day; gradually trends down late.
- Fri (10/17): Slow easer all day, still sizable and powerful at top exposures.
- Sat (10/18): Down another notch for most of the day; long-period NW forerunners (**5 ft** @ 18 s; travel time ~2.7 days from the Gulf of Alaska source) slated to arrive near/after sunset, with more material likely overnight into Sunday.

Confidence: Moderate (0.68). Strength-of-signal is solid on regional buoys for the NNW event, and climatology favors early-season NNW pulses. However, several feeds are missing (models, altimetry, nearshore buoys, satellite, upper-air), so decay rates and the exact onset of the Sat forerunners could be off by 6–12 hours, and nearshore transformation details carry more uncertainty than usual.

## South Shore Forecast

South Shore forecast (Thu 10/16 – Sat 10/18), in brief
- Size/period/direction: Background S–SSW pulses in the **12–14s** band dominate; trace NW/WNW wrap rides shotgun. No true southern-hemisphere storm signal on the charts.
- Nearshore breakers (faces):
  • Thu: H1/3 **2 ft**, H1/10 **3 ft** from 190–205°. Trace W–NW wrap <**1 ft**.
  • Fri: H1/3 1.**5–2 ft**, H1/10 2.**5–3 ft** from 190–205°. Trace W–NW wrap <**1 ft**.
  • Sat: H1/3 1.**5–2 ft**, H1/10 2.**5–3 ft** from 185–200°. Late-day, rare knee-thigh pulses from first-arriving NNW 18s wrap at select magnets.
- Timing: Most consistency on the tide push late morning to midday; smallest overnight and late afternoon lows. Morning winds are lightest; trades build and texture the bump by late morning onward.

What’s driving it
- Background southern hemi: Lingering S–SSW swell energy in the **12–14s** band keeps Town rideable but small through Saturday. This is classic October—end of season background, not a storm-fed run.
- Wrap potential: Large NNW–NW energy in the basin is well sampled on buoys but is heavily blocked for Town. Expect only a whisper of wrap through the deep channels for west-facing nooks (Rockpiles/Kaisers zone) Thursday–Friday. A new, long-period NNW pulse (~**5 ft** @ 18s deepwater) is modeled to reach the islands late Saturday; that will barely tickle wrap magnets near sunset with very inconsistent knee-thigh lines. For most south-facing reefs, it’s a non-factor.

Town vs outliers (winds and tides)
- Ala Moana (Bowls/Kaisers/Rockpiles):
  • Bowls: Best of the bunch for the S–SSW background, but still small. Cleanest at dawn with light ENE land breeze; trades turn it side-on and bumpy late morning onward. Mid tide helps the shape; very low tide makes it shallow and pinchy.
  • Kaisers/Rockpiles: Slightly better odds than Bowls to feel any W–NW wrap, but we’re talking marginal (<**1 ft**) Thu–Fri. If the late-Sat NNW 18s sets sneak in, expect long lulls and occasional knee-thigh lines—more novelty than session-maker.
- Waikiki: Most consistent option with the small S–SSW. Ideal for logs/SUPs. Handles trades better than the reefs, so afternoons can still be workable. Higher tides favor glide; very low tides expose the inside and shorten rides.
- Diamond Head: Limited exposure to the S–SSW source and no help from the NNW wrap. With trades, expect warble but rideable ramps early; best window is dawn before the breeze fills. Mainly knee–thigh, with occasional waist-high peaks on the better sets.

Boards, crowds, consistency
- Best craft: Longboards and mid-lengths rule; grovelly twins/fish for the reefs. Performance shortboards will feel undergunned except on the rare Bowls set.
- Consistency: Long waits—10 to 15 minutes between better pulses; even longer for any wrap set at the magnets.
- Crowds: Typical fall Town crowding focused on the few peaks showing push (Bowls at dawn, Canoes/Queens all day). Expect an uptick Saturday a.m. with weekend traffic despite no real size bump.

Local winds and quality
- Winds: Presently light ENE (~070° around 5–10 kt) at dawn, trending moderate trades by late morning through afternoons—side-onshore texture for most Town reefs. Diamond Head tolerates wind best; Waikiki is relatively sheltered.
- Quality: Fair to fair–poor overall. Best surface conditions at first light; degrade to choppy/crumbly mid to late morning as the trades fill. Quality index around mid-pack (≈0.45) is a good reflection.

Notes on data and confidence
- Confidence is medium (0.68). Several feeds missing (altimetry, models, nearshore buoys), and one short-lived “SW 13s at **16 ft**” buoy blip is almost certainly spurious/directional aliasing given regional charts and climatology. The call leans on functioning buoys, tides, METARs, and October norms. No tropical assistance expected.

Bottom line
- Thu–Sat stays small: mainly knee–waist with the odd chest-high set at focal Town reefs on the tide push. NW wrap is negligible for Town until a token, very long-period tease near sunset Saturday at the usual west-facing magnets. Dawn patrol with a log or fish is your highest-yield play.

## Daily Forecast

HEADLINE: XL NNW dominates with still-solid SSW; light ENE trades early — expert-only north/west, select south reefs at dawn.

NORTH SHORE: 18–25+ ft faces on sets, NNW (320–340°) **14–15s** energy. Best window dawn to mid-morning under light ENE side-off; strong, long-period sets and heavy currents. Outer reefs/Waimea on; most spots hazardous.

SOUTH SHORE: **5–8 ft** faces, occasional 8–10+ at top SW magnets (205–220°) **12–14s**; inconsistent but powerful sets. Best at first light before trades/sea-breeze texture; long lulls, backwash on higher tides.

EAST: Trade-wind exposures choppy and jumbled; wrap from NNW lights up select leeward corners but currents and sideshore winds limit quality.

WEST: 8–15+ ft faces from combined NNW and some SW wrap; cleaner under ENE offshore early. Heavy sweep and wide sets near channels; expert only at exposed reefs.

WINDS: ENE (070°) around 5–10 kt early, building moderate trades by late morning/afternoon. This is side-off to offshore for North and West (cleanest early), partial cross-off for South (manageable at dawn), onshore and bumpy for East.

TIDES (Honolulu 1612340; feed partial):
- Trend: Low was near dusk Wed; rising overnight toward a late morning/near-midday high around **2 ft**; falling again late afternoon to a very low near/after sunset (~0.**2 ft**). Verify exact times locally.
- Impacts: More push/backwash on late-morning highs south; stronger draw and exposed reefs on evening lows north/west.

HAZARDS: XL long-period NNW with still-solid SSW crossing — rogue sets, wide wrap, powerful rip currents, harbor surges, and shorebreak. Reefs washing through; cliff/rock splash zones dangerous.

ACTION ITEM: Experts with proper safety gear: go at first light on protected North/West reefs; Waimea/outer reefs only with team. Everyone else: pick the most sheltered South reefs right at dawn or stand down.
