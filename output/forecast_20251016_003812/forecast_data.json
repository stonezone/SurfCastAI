Typical lighter AMs, breezier PMs. Forecast confidence: medium (0.68). Models/altimetry feeds are missing; leaning on buoy snapshots and charts.\n\nDETAILS\n- Long-period NW event (Gulf of Alaska):\n  - Source: ~50N 148W, 971 mb storm, ENE ~20 kt with storm-force backside fetch aimed 310\u2013340\u00b0 toward HI. OPC shows 8\u201310+ m source seas.\n  - Physics-based arrival: deepwater 5 ft @ 18 s Saturday ~5:32 PM HST (distance ~1800 nm; 2.7 days). Expect 20 s scouts mid/late afternoon, 18 s filling evening. Nearshore H1/3 builds from 2\u20133 ft midday to 4\u20136 ft late, with H1/10 sets to 6\u20138+ ft faces at focal reefs by dusk/night.\n  - Buoys: 51001 (far NE Pac) should show the bulk long before Oahu; 51101 (NW of Kauai) is the key trigger for Oahu timing of the 18\u201320 s band.\n- Mid-period NNW\u2013NW mix (holding Thu\u2013Fri):\n  - Drivers: post-frontal gale ~44N 170W and a frontal wave near 31N 165W keeping 12\u201315 s energy in the 300\u2013340\u00b0 sector.\n  - Nearshore: H1/3 3\u20134 ft Thu, 3\u20135 ft Fri, H1/10 sets 5\u20137 ft faces on best exposures. Some shorter-period N windswell blends in.\n  - Buoys: 51101/nearby arrays should hold mid-period energy; check for subtle reinforcement Friday.\n- Trades/short-period ENE:\n  - Ridge 1031\u20131032 mb near 33N 145\u2013150W maintains E\u2013ENE trades. Windward surf 2\u20134 ft H1/3, 7\u20139 s. Buoys 51003/51004 supportive.\n- South exposures:\n  - No South Pacific source recently; CPC tropical outlook quiet for 7 days. The matrix\u2019s SW 214\u00b0 16 ft @ 13 s print is inconsistent with season/pattern and likely a partition artifact; expect 1\u20132 ft H1/3, inconsistent.\n\nNORTH SHORE\n- Thu (10/16): NNW\u2013NW 13\u201315 s. H1/3 3\u20134 ft; H1/10 sets near 5\u20136 ft faces at top exposures. Light E flow early; moderate trades PM. Fair conditions at many reefs with side/offshore bias.\n- Fri (10/17): Similar or a notch up. H1/3 3\u20135 ft; sets 5\u20137 ft faces. Mixed periods keep consistency decent. Manageable winds.\n- Sat (10/18): AM modest 3\u20134 ft. Forerunners 18\u201320 s by afternoon; sharper rise late to H1/3 4\u20136 ft with H1/10 6\u20138+ ft faces at Sunset/Waimea/Pipeline by dusk and into the night. E\u2013ENE trades are side/offshore; expect stronger currents with the rising long-period energy.\n- Notes: Use 51001 for early heads-up and 51101 for imminent arrival. Timing/size carries medium confidence given missing model/altimetry feeds; adjust with buoy trends.\n\nSOUTH SHORE\n- Thu\u2013Sat: Background S\u2013SSW 12\u201314 s only. H1/3 1\u20132 ft; H1/10 2\u20133 ft faces on the better magnets. Trades are side/offshore; mornings cleanest. A whisper of N wrap possible Saturday evening on select southern exposures as NW energy noses in, but minimal.\n\nEAST (WINDWARD)\n- Thu\u2013Sat: Trade swell steady at H1/3 2\u20134 ft (7\u20139 s), choppy PM with trades, cleaner AMs. Northern Windward exposures may see extra NNW wrap Fri\u2013Sat pushing sets to 3\u20135 ft faces at times.\n\nOUTLOOK\n- Sun (10/19): The NW long-period swell should be the main event. H1/3 5\u20138 ft on the North Shore with H1/10 sets 8\u201312 ft faces at focal reefs; still building early, leveling/peaking through the day. Trades moderate E\u2013ENE.\n- Mon (10/20): Gradual easing but still solid: H1/3 4\u20136 ft; H1/10 6\u20139 ft faces. Windward steady 2\u20134 ft trades. South shore remains near-flat.\n- Next potential: A pre-dateline gale near 35\u201340N, 170E\u2013180 bears watching. If it reorients toward 170W with a meridional fetch, a conditional WNW (290\u2013310\u00b0) pulse could follow mid-next week. Low confidence at this lead.\n\nData/Confidence notes\n- Confidence medium (0.68). Altimetry, models, nearshore buoy feeds missing; relied on surface charts, CPC outlook, and available NDBC buoys (51101/51001 for NW, 51003/51004 for trades). The SW 214\u00b0 13 s \u201c16 ft\u201d buoy line is discounted as spurious given regional pattern and lack of South Pacific support.",
  "north_shore": "Lead: A very large, long-period NNW swell (330\u00b0 \u00b110\u00b0) dominates Thu\u2013Fri, with deep-water H1/3 near 15\u201316 ft and H1/10 near 20 ft on the buoys (exposure weight ~0.93 for open North Shore), translating to roughly 20\u201330 ft faces with occasional 30\u201340 ft sets at the most exposed reefs, peaking overnight Wed\u2013Thu, holding through Thu, and easing Fri; forerunners of the next NW pulse (about 5 ft @ 18 s from the Gulf of Alaska) are due late Sat toward dusk.\n\nWind and tides: Light to moderate ENE trades early (around 070\u00b0 at 5\u201310 kt per METAR), trending E 10\u201315+ kt each afternoon, gives the classic morning window: cleaner and a bit offshore for Pipe/Backdoor, more cross for Sunset, and manageable at Waimea. Afternoon onshores add bump and warble, most noticeable at wide-open exposures. Predawn lower tides with higher afternoon tides through the period favor tubes at lower water on the reefs early; the higher afternoon tide helps Waimea smooth out but can increase surges near harbor mouths. Note: local tide precision is limited from the feed; lean on on-site checks for session timing.\n\nFlagship breaks:\n- Pipeline/Backdoor (exposure strong to 330\u00b0 NNW): Thu very solid 15\u201320 ft faces with second-reef sets 20\u201325+ and intermittent first-reef closeouts; Fri easing to 10\u201315 ft, still powerful; Sat morning down to 6\u201310 ft, with a slight tick up late day as 18 s forerunners sneak in near dusk. Best quality early with light ENE; afternoons trend side/onshore and lumpy.\n- Sunset Beach (max exposure; weight ~0.93): Thu XL 20\u201330 ft faces with occasional 30\u201335+ bombs; strong currents and wide playing field; Fri 12\u201318 ft, easing; Sat 8\u201312 ft AM, holding or bumping late PM on forerunners. Mornings fair; afternoons bumpy with trades.\n- Waimea Bay (likes N\u2013NW long period): Thu 18\u201325 ft faces with sets pushing 30 ft during peak; Fri 12\u201318 ft; Sat 8\u201312 ft with late-day pulses possible. Higher tide helps the roll-ins; currents and surges significant even as it drops.\n\nBuoy evidence and exposure notes:\n- Primary energy is the NNW 15\u201316 ft @ 15 s cluster from ~329\u2013343\u00b0 with strong North Shore exposure (weights ~0.93 for NNW, ~0.82 for NW). This aligns with the observed jump on the buoys and supports warning-level surf at the most open reefs.\n- Secondary NW/WNW components (13 ft @ 13 s from ~300\u2013310\u00b0 and ~7 ft @ 13 s WNW) add cross energy but are a sideshow to the dominant NNW. Pipeline is partially shadowed from WNW, but the NNW angle opens it up and can make the first reef unruly at peak size.\n- Large SW (214\u00b0) energy on the buoys is heavily shadowed for the North Shore and is not a meaningful contributor here.\n\nHazards: Expect high to warning-level surf on Thu for north exposures. Very strong rip and longshore currents, powerful shorebreak in exposed pockets, outer-reef wash-throughs, and harbor surges (e.g., Haleiwa) are likely during the peak. Only expert-level big-wave equipment and teams should consider outer reefs and Waimea during the max.\n\nOutlook and timing:\n- Thu (10/16): Peak of the event overnight into morning; holds high through the day; gradually trends down late.\n- Fri (10/17): Slow easer all day, still sizable and powerful at top exposures.\n- Sat (10/18): Down another notch for most of the day; long-period NW forerunners (5 ft @ 18 s; travel time ~2.7 days from the Gulf of Alaska source) slated to arrive near/after sunset, with more material likely overnight into Sunday.\n\nConfidence: Moderate (0.68). Strength-of-signal is solid on regional buoys for the NNW event, and climatology favors early-season NNW pulses. However, several feeds are missing (models, altimetry, nearshore buoys, satellite, upper-air), so decay rates and the exact onset of the Sat forerunners could be off by 6\u201312 hours, and nearshore transformation details carry more uncertainty than usual.",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast (Thu 10/16 \u2013 Sat 10/18), in brief\n- Size/period/direction: Background S\u2013SSW pulses in the 12\u201314s band dominate; trace NW/WNW wrap rides shotgun. No true southern-hemisphere storm signal on the charts.\n- Nearshore breakers (faces): \n  \u2022 Thu: H1/3 2 ft, H1/10 3 ft from 190\u2013205\u00b0. Trace W\u2013NW wrap <1 ft. \n  \u2022 Fri: H1/3 1.5\u20132 ft, H1/10 2.5\u20133 ft from 190\u2013205\u00b0. Trace W\u2013NW wrap <1 ft. \n  \u2022 Sat: H1/3 1.5\u20132 ft, H1/10 2.5\u20133 ft from 185\u2013200\u00b0. Late-day, rare knee-thigh pulses from first-arriving NNW 18s wrap at select magnets.\n- Timing: Most consistency on the tide push late morning to midday; smallest overnight and late afternoon lows. Morning winds are lightest; trades build and texture the bump by late morning onward.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving it\n- Background southern hemi: Lingering S\u2013SSW swell energy in the 12\u201314s band keeps Town rideable but small through Saturday. This is classic October\u2014end of season background, not a storm-fed run.\n- Wrap potential: Large NNW\u2013NW energy in the basin is well sampled on buoys but is heavily blocked for Town. Expect only a whisper of wrap through the deep channels for west-facing nooks (Rockpiles/Kaisers zone) Thursday\u2013Friday. A new, long-period NNW pulse (~5 ft @ 18s deepwater) is modeled to reach the islands late Saturday; that will barely tickle wrap magnets near sunset with very inconsistent knee-thigh lines. For most south-facing reefs, it\u2019s a non-factor.\n\nTown vs outliers (winds and tides)\n- Ala Moana (Bowls/Kaisers/Rockpiles):\n  \u2022 Bowls: Best of the bunch for the S\u2013SSW background, but still small. Cleanest at dawn with light ENE land breeze; trades turn it side-on and bumpy late morning onward. Mid tide helps the shape; very low tide makes it shallow and pinchy.\n  \u2022 Kaisers/Rockpiles: Slightly better odds than Bowls to feel any W\u2013NW wrap, but we\u2019re talking marginal (<1 ft) Thu\u2013Fri. If the late-Sat NNW 18s sets sneak in, expect long lulls and occasional knee-thigh lines\u2014more novelty than session-maker.\n- Waikiki: Most consistent option with the small S\u2013SSW. Ideal for logs/SUPs. Handles trades better than the reefs, so afternoons can still be workable. Higher tides favor glide; very low tides expose the inside and shorten rides.\n- Diamond Head: Limited exposure to the S\u2013SSW source and no help from the NNW wrap. With trades, expect warble but rideable ramps early; best window is dawn before the breeze fills. Mainly knee\u2013thigh, with occasional waist-high peaks on the better sets.\n\nBoards, crowds, consistency\n- Best craft: Longboards and mid-lengths rule; grovelly twins/fish for the reefs. Performance shortboards will feel undergunned except on the rare Bowls set.\n- Consistency: Long waits\u201410 to 15 minutes between better pulses; even longer for any wrap set at the magnets.\n- Crowds: Typical fall Town crowding focused on the few peaks showing push (Bowls at dawn, Canoes/Queens all day). Expect an uptick Saturday a.m. with weekend traffic despite no real size bump.\n\nLocal winds and quality\n- Winds: Presently light ENE (~070\u00b0 around 5\u201310 kt) at dawn, trending moderate trades by late morning through afternoons\u2014side-onshore texture for most Town reefs. Diamond Head tolerates wind best; Waikiki is relatively sheltered. \n- Quality: Fair to fair\u2013poor overall. Best surface conditions at first light; degrade to choppy/crumbly mid to late morning as the trades fill. Quality index around mid-pack (\u22480.45) is a good reflection.\n\nNotes on data and confidence\n- Confidence is medium (0.68). Several feeds missing (altimetry, models, nearshore buoys), and one short-lived \u201cSW 13s at 16 ft\u201d buoy blip is almost certainly spurious/directional aliasing given regional charts and climatology. The call leans on functioning buoys, tides, METARs, and October norms. No tropical assistance expected.\n\nBottom line\n- Thu\u2013Sat stays small: mainly knee\u2013waist with the odd chest-high set at focal Town reefs on the tide push. NW wrap is negligible for Town until a token, very long-period tease near sunset Saturday at the usual west-facing magnets. Dawn patrol with a log or fish is your highest-yield play.",
  "daily": "HEADLINE: XL NNW dominates with still-solid SSW; light ENE trades early \u2014 expert-only north/west, select south reefs at dawn.\n\nNORTH SHORE: 18\u201325+ ft faces on sets, NNW (320\u2013340\u00b0) 14\u201315s energy. Best window dawn to mid-morning under light ENE side-off; strong, long-period sets and heavy currents. Outer reefs/Waimea on; most spots hazardous.\n\nSOUTH SHORE: 5\u20138 ft faces, occasional 8\u201310+ at top SW magnets (205\u2013220\u00b0) 12\u201314s; inconsistent but powerful sets. Best at first light before trades/sea-breeze texture; long lulls, backwash on higher tides.\n\nEAST: Trade-wind exposures choppy and jumbled; wrap from NNW lights up select leeward corners but currents and sideshore winds limit quality.\n\nWEST: 8\u201315+ ft faces from combined NNW and some SW wrap; cleaner under ENE offshore early. Heavy sweep and wide sets near channels; expert only at exposed reefs.\n\nWINDS: ENE (070\u00b0) around 5\u201310 kt early, building moderate trades by late morning/afternoon. This is side-off to offshore for North and West (cleanest early), partial cross-off for South (manageable at dawn), onshore and bumpy for East.\n\nTIDES (Honolulu 1612340; feed partial): \n- Trend: Low was near dusk Wed; rising overnight toward a late morning/near-midday high around 2 ft; falling again late afternoon to a very low near/after sunset (~0.2 ft). Verify exact times locally.\n- Impacts: More push/backwash on late-morning highs south; stronger draw and exposed reefs on evening lows north/west.\n\nHAZARDS: XL long-period NNW with still-solid SSW crossing \u2014 rogue sets, wide wrap, powerful rip currents, harbor surges, and shorebreak. Reefs washing through; cliff/rock splash zones dangerous.\n\nACTION ITEM: Experts with proper safety gear: go at first light on protected North/West reefs; Waimea/outer reefs only with team. Everyone else: pick the most sheltered South reefs right at dawn or stand down.",
