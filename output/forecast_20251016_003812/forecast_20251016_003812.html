| Day/Window           | Direction (deg/cardinal) | Period (s) | H1/3 (ft) | H1/10 est (ft) | Trend                    | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Thu 10/16            | NNW–NW (300–340)         | 13–15      | 3–4       | 5–6            | Steady                    | Post-frontal mid-period mix; modest N windswell component. Watch 51101/51001. |
| Fri 10/17            | NNW–NW (305–330)         | 12–14      | 3–5       | 5–7            | Steady to slight bump     | Reinforcing mid-period NNW. 51101 should hold; 51001 leads. |

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dominant feature: a long-period NW (310–330°) swell from a 971 mb Gulf low, forerunners due Saturday afternoon with a sharper rise near/after sunset; peak likely Sunday outside this window.</li>
<li>Until then, small-moderate, mid-period NNW–NW keeps the North Shore active Thursday–Friday.</li>
<li>Winds: E–ENE trades light to moderate (PHNL 070°/8 kt late Wed). Typical lighter AMs, breezier PMs. Forecast confidence: medium (0.68). Models/altimetry feeds are missing; leaning on buoy snapshots and charts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Long-period NW event (Gulf of Alaska):</li>
<li>Source: ~50N 148W, 971 mb storm, ENE ~20 kt with storm-force backside fetch aimed 310–340° toward HI. OPC shows 8–10+ m source seas.</li>
<li>Physics-based arrival: deepwater <strong>5 ft</strong> @ 18 s Saturday ~5:32 PM HST (distance ~1800 nm; 2.7 days). Expect 20 s scouts mid/late afternoon, 18 s filling evening. Nearshore H1/3 builds from <strong>2–3 ft</strong> midday to <strong>4–6 ft</strong> late, with H1/10 sets to 6–8+ ft faces at focal reefs by dusk/night.</li>
<li>Buoys: 51001 (far NE Pac) should show the bulk long before Oahu; 51101 (NW of Kauai) is the key trigger for Oahu timing of the <strong>18–20 s</strong> band.</li>
<li>Mid-period NNW–NW mix (holding Thu–Fri):</li>
<li>Drivers: post-frontal gale ~44N 170W and a frontal wave near 31N 165W keeping <strong>12–15 s</strong> energy in the 300–340° sector.</li>
<li>Nearshore: H1/3 <strong>3–4 ft</strong> Thu, <strong>3–5 ft</strong> Fri, H1/10 sets <strong>5–7 ft</strong> faces on best exposures. Some shorter-period N windswell blends in.</li>
<li>Buoys: 51101/nearby arrays should hold mid-period energy; check for subtle reinforcement Friday.</li>
<li>Trades/short-period ENE:</li>
<li>Ridge 1031–1032 mb near 33N 145–150W maintains E–ENE trades. Windward surf <strong>2–4 ft</strong> H1/3, <strong>7–9 s</strong>. Buoys 51003/51004 supportive.</li>
<li>South exposures:</li>
<li>No South Pacific source recently; CPC tropical outlook quiet for 7 days. The matrix’s SW 214° <strong>16 ft</strong> @ 13 s print is inconsistent with season/pattern and likely a partition artifact; expect <strong>1–2 ft</strong> H1/3, inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>North Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thu (10/16): NNW–NW <strong>13–15 s</strong>. H1/3 <strong>3–4 ft</strong>; H1/10 sets near <strong>5–6 ft</strong> faces at top exposures. Light E flow early; moderate trades PM. Fair conditions at many reefs with side/offshore bias.</li>
<li>Fri (10/17): Similar or a notch up. H1/3 <strong>3–5 ft</strong>; sets <strong>5–7 ft</strong> faces. Mixed periods keep consistency decent. Manageable winds.</li>
<li>Sat (10/18): AM modest <strong>3–4 ft</strong>. Forerunners <strong>18–20 s</strong> by afternoon; sharper rise late to H1/3 <strong>4–6 ft</strong> with H1/10 6–8+ ft faces at Sunset/Waimea/Pipeline by dusk and into the night. E–ENE trades are side/offshore; expect stronger currents with the rising long-period energy.</li>
<li>Notes: Use 51001 for early heads-up and 51101 for imminent arrival. Timing/size carries medium confidence given missing model/altimetry feeds; adjust with buoy trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>South Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thu–Sat: Background S–SSW <strong>12–14 s</strong> only. H1/3 <strong>1–2 ft</strong>; H1/10 <strong>2–3 ft</strong> faces on the better magnets. Trades are side/offshore; mornings cleanest. A whisper of N wrap possible Saturday evening on select southern exposures as NW energy noses in, but minimal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>East (Windward)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thu–Sat: Trade swell steady at H1/3 <strong>2–4 ft</strong> (<strong>7–9 s</strong>), choppy PM with trades, cleaner AMs. Northern Windward exposures may see extra NNW wrap Fri–Sat pushing sets to <strong>3–5 ft</strong> faces at times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sun (10/19): The NW long-period swell should be the main event. H1/3 <strong>5–8 ft</strong> on the North Shore with H1/10 sets <strong>8–12 ft</strong> faces at focal reefs; still building early, leveling/peaking through the day. Trades moderate E–ENE.</li>
<li>Mon (10/20): Gradual easing but still solid: H1/3 <strong>4–6 ft</strong>; H1/10 <strong>6–9 ft</strong> faces. Windward steady <strong>2–4 ft</strong> trades. South shore remains near-flat.</li>
<li>Next potential: A pre-dateline gale near 35–40N, 170E–180 bears watching. If it reorients toward 170W with a meridional fetch, a conditional WNW (290–310°) pulse could follow mid-next week. Low confidence at this lead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data/Confidence notes
- Confidence medium (0.68). Altimetry, models, nearshore buoy feeds missing; relied on surface charts, CPC outlook, and available NDBC buoys (51101/51001 for NW, 51003/51004 for trades). The SW 214° 13 s “<strong>16 ft</strong>” buoy line is discounted as spurious given regional pattern and lack of South Pacific support.</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Lead: A very large, long-period NNW swell (330° ±10°) dominates Thu–Fri, with deep-water H1/3 near <strong>15–16 ft</strong> and H1/10 near <strong>20 ft</strong> on the buoys (exposure weight ~0.93 for open North Shore), translating to roughly <strong>20–30 ft</strong> faces with occasional <strong>30–40 ft</strong> sets at the most exposed reefs, peaking overnight Wed–Thu, holding through Thu, and easing Fri; forerunners of the next NW pulse (about <strong>5 ft</strong> @ 18 s from the Gulf of Alaska) are due late Sat toward dusk.</p>
<p>Wind and tides: Light to moderate ENE trades early (around 070° at 5–10 kt per METAR), trending E 10–15+ kt each afternoon, gives the classic morning window: cleaner and a bit offshore for Pipe/Backdoor, more cross for Sunset, and manageable at Waimea. Afternoon onshores add bump and warble, most noticeable at wide-open exposures. Predawn lower tides with higher afternoon tides through the period favor tubes at lower water on the reefs early; the higher afternoon tide helps Waimea smooth out but can increase surges near harbor mouths. Note: local tide precision is limited from the feed; lean on on-site checks for session timing.</p>
<p>Flagship breaks:
- Pipeline/Backdoor (exposure strong to 330° NNW): Thu very solid <strong>15–20 ft</strong> faces with second-reef sets 20–25+ and intermittent first-reef closeouts; Fri easing to <strong>10–15 ft</strong>, still powerful; Sat morning down to <strong>6–10 ft</strong>, with a slight tick up late day as 18 s forerunners sneak in near dusk. Best quality early with light ENE; afternoons trend side/onshore and lumpy.
- Sunset Beach (max exposure; weight ~0.93): Thu XL <strong>20–30 ft</strong> faces with occasional 30–35+ bombs; strong currents and wide playing field; Fri <strong>12–18 ft</strong>, easing; Sat <strong>8–12 ft</strong> AM, holding or bumping late PM on forerunners. Mornings fair; afternoons bumpy with trades.
- Waimea Bay (likes N–NW long period): Thu <strong>18–25 ft</strong> faces with sets pushing <strong>30 ft</strong> during peak; Fri <strong>12–18 ft</strong>; Sat <strong>8–12 ft</strong> with late-day pulses possible. Higher tide helps the roll-ins; currents and surges significant even as it drops.</p>
<p>Buoy evidence and exposure notes:
- Primary energy is the NNW <strong>15–16 ft</strong> @ 15 s cluster from ~329–343° with strong North Shore exposure (weights ~0.93 for NNW, ~0.82 for NW). This aligns with the observed jump on the buoys and supports warning-level surf at the most open reefs.
- Secondary NW/WNW components (<strong>13 ft</strong> @ 13 s from ~300–310° and ~<strong>7 ft</strong> @ 13 s WNW) add cross energy but are a sideshow to the dominant NNW. Pipeline is partially shadowed from WNW, but the NNW angle opens it up and can make the first reef unruly at peak size.
- Large SW (214°) energy on the buoys is heavily shadowed for the North Shore and is not a meaningful contributor here.</p>
<p>Hazards: Expect high to warning-level surf on Thu for north exposures. Very strong rip and longshore currents, powerful shorebreak in exposed pockets, outer-reef wash-throughs, and harbor surges (e.g., Haleiwa) are likely during the peak. Only expert-level big-wave equipment and teams should consider outer reefs and Waimea during the max.</p>
<p>Outlook and timing:
- Thu (10/16): Peak of the event overnight into morning; holds high through the day; gradually trends down late.
- Fri (10/17): Slow easer all day, still sizable and powerful at top exposures.
- Sat (10/18): Down another notch for most of the day; long-period NW forerunners (<strong>5 ft</strong> @ 18 s; travel time ~2.7 days from the Gulf of Alaska source) slated to arrive near/after sunset, with more material likely overnight into Sunday.</p>
<p>Confidence: Moderate (0.68). Strength-of-signal is solid on regional buoys for the NNW event, and climatology favors early-season NNW pulses. However, several feeds are missing (models, altimetry, nearshore buoys, satellite, upper-air), so decay rates and the exact onset of the Sat forerunners could be off by 6–12 hours, and nearshore transformation details carry more uncertainty than usual.</p>

            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>South Shore forecast (Thu 10/16 – Sat 10/18), in brief
- Size/period/direction: Background S–SSW pulses in the <strong>12–14s</strong> band dominate; trace NW/WNW wrap rides shotgun. No true southern-hemisphere storm signal on the charts.
- Nearshore breakers (faces): 
  • Thu: H1/3 <strong>2 ft</strong>, H1/10 <strong>3 ft</strong> from 190–205°. Trace W–NW wrap &lt;<strong>1 ft</strong>. 
  • Fri: H1/3 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong>, H1/10 2.<strong>5–3 ft</strong> from 190–205°. Trace W–NW wrap &lt;<strong>1 ft</strong>. 
  • Sat: H1/3 1.<strong>5–2 ft</strong>, H1/10 2.<strong>5–3 ft</strong> from 185–200°. Late-day, rare knee-thigh pulses from first-arriving NNW 18s wrap at select magnets.
- Timing: Most consistency on the tide push late morning to midday; smallest overnight and late afternoon lows. Morning winds are lightest; trades build and texture the bump by late morning onward.</p>
<p>What’s driving it
- Background southern hemi: Lingering S–SSW swell energy in the <strong>12–14s</strong> band keeps Town rideable but small through Saturday. This is classic October—end of season background, not a storm-fed run.
- Wrap potential: Large NNW–NW energy in the basin is well sampled on buoys but is heavily blocked for Town. Expect only a whisper of wrap through the deep channels for west-facing nooks (Rockpiles/Kaisers zone) Thursday–Friday. A new, long-period NNW pulse (~<strong>5 ft</strong> @ 18s deepwater) is modeled to reach the islands late Saturday; that will barely tickle wrap magnets near sunset with very inconsistent knee-thigh lines. For most south-facing reefs, it’s a non-factor.</p>
<p>Town vs outliers (winds and tides)
- Ala Moana (Bowls/Kaisers/Rockpiles):
  • Bowls: Best of the bunch for the S–SSW background, but still small. Cleanest at dawn with light ENE land breeze; trades turn it side-on and bumpy late morning onward. Mid tide helps the shape; very low tide makes it shallow and pinchy.
  • Kaisers/Rockpiles: Slightly better odds than Bowls to feel any W–NW wrap, but we’re talking marginal (&lt;<strong>1 ft</strong>) Thu–Fri. If the late-Sat NNW 18s sets sneak in, expect long lulls and occasional knee-thigh lines—more novelty than session-maker.
- Waikiki: Most consistent option with the small S–SSW. Ideal for logs/SUPs. Handles trades better than the reefs, so afternoons can still be workable. Higher tides favor glide; very low tides expose the inside and shorten rides.
- Diamond Head: Limited exposure to the S–SSW source and no help from the NNW wrap. With trades, expect warble but rideable ramps early; best window is dawn before the breeze fills. Mainly knee–thigh, with occasional waist-high peaks on the better sets.</p>
<p>Boards, crowds, consistency
- Best craft: Longboards and mid-lengths rule; grovelly twins/fish for the reefs. Performance shortboards will feel undergunned except on the rare Bowls set.
- Consistency: Long waits—10 to 15 minutes between better pulses; even longer for any wrap set at the magnets.
- Crowds: Typical fall Town crowding focused on the few peaks showing push (Bowls at dawn, Canoes/Queens all day). Expect an uptick Saturday a.m. with weekend traffic despite no real size bump.</p>
<p>Local winds and quality
- Winds: Presently light ENE (~070° around 5–10 kt) at dawn, trending moderate trades by late morning through afternoons—side-onshore texture for most Town reefs. Diamond Head tolerates wind best; Waikiki is relatively sheltered. 
- Quality: Fair to fair–poor overall. Best surface conditions at first light; degrade to choppy/crumbly mid to late morning as the trades fill. Quality index around mid-pack (≈0.45) is a good reflection.</p>
<p>Notes on data and confidence
- Confidence is medium (0.68). Several feeds missing (altimetry, models, nearshore buoys), and one short-lived “SW 13s at <strong>16 ft</strong>” buoy blip is almost certainly spurious/directional aliasing given regional charts and climatology. The call leans on functioning buoys, tides, METARs, and October norms. No tropical assistance expected.</p>
<p>Bottom line
- Thu–Sat stays small: mainly knee–waist with the odd chest-high set at focal Town reefs on the tide push. NW wrap is negligible for Town until a token, very long-period tease near sunset Saturday at the usual west-facing magnets. Dawn patrol with a log or fish is your highest-yield play.</p>

    <div class="forecast-section">
        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>HEADLINE: XL NNW dominates with still-solid SSW; light ENE trades early — expert-only north/west, select south reefs at dawn.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE: 18–25+ ft faces on sets, NNW (320–340°) <strong>14–15s</strong> energy. Best window dawn to mid-morning under light ENE side-off; strong, long-period sets and heavy currents. Outer reefs/Waimea on; most spots hazardous.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE: <strong>5–8 ft</strong> faces, occasional 8–10+ at top SW magnets (205–220°) <strong>12–14s</strong>; inconsistent but powerful sets. Best at first light before trades/sea-breeze texture; long lulls, backwash on higher tides.</p>
<p>EAST: Trade-wind exposures choppy and jumbled; wrap from NNW lights up select leeward corners but currents and sideshore winds limit quality.</p>
<p>WEST: 8–15+ ft faces from combined NNW and some SW wrap; cleaner under ENE offshore early. Heavy sweep and wide sets near channels; expert only at exposed reefs.</p>
<p>WINDS: ENE (070°) around 5–10 kt early, building moderate trades by late morning/afternoon. This is side-off to offshore for North and West (cleanest early), partial cross-off for South (manageable at dawn), onshore and bumpy for East.</p>
<p>TIDES (Honolulu 1612340; feed partial): 
- Trend: Low was near dusk Wed; rising overnight toward a late morning/near-midday high around <strong>2 ft</strong>; falling again late afternoon to a very low near/after sunset (~0.<strong>2 ft</strong>). Verify exact times locally.
- Impacts: More push/backwash on late-morning highs south; stronger draw and exposed reefs on evening lows north/west.</p>
<p>HAZARDS: XL long-period NNW with still-solid SSW crossing — rogue sets, wide wrap, powerful rip currents, harbor surges, and shorebreak. Reefs washing through; cliff/rock splash zones dangerous.</p>
<p>ACTION ITEM: Experts with proper safety gear: go at first light on protected North/West reefs; Waimea/outer reefs only with team. Everyone else: pick the most sheltered South reefs right at dawn or stand down.</p>
