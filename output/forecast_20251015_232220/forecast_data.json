Trades are E\u2013ENE ~8\u201310 kt (PHNL METAR 07009KT), so east faces will be bumpy. A separate Aleutian pulse (6 ft @13 s) is predicted to arrive midday Fri 10/17. Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0; data gaps (no altimetry/models/nearshore buoys) lower precision.\n\nDETAILS\n- NW (307\u00b0) \u2014 Window: observed 10/15 22:56 HST. Source: buoy reports and synoptic analysis; tied to a deep 970 mb extratropical low north of Hawaii (pressure chart). Expect long periods (14 s+) and significant energy \u2014 large sets and wide intervals at exposed NW reefs/points. Verify with NDBC/NOAA buoys (recommend checks: 51001, 51002, 51003 and high\u2011latitude buoys such as 46089 / 46026 for fetch confirmation).\n- N (350\u2013354\u00b0) \u2014 Window: observed 10/15 22:56 HST. Secondary N component around 11.2 ft H1/3 @13 s; steeper, shorter period than the core NW \u2014 will fill in exposed north points and can produce punchy, frequent sets.\n- S (186\u00b0) \u2014 Window: observed 10/15 22:50 HST. Long\u2011period southerly energy shown at H1/3 8.5 ft @14 s. Southern energy is real but will be variably shadowed by island orientation and subtropical ridge \u2014 expect reduced south set faces at many beaches.\n- W (268\u00b0) \u2014 Window: observed 10/15 22:30 HST. Moderate westerly groundswell energy adds cross\u2011traffic to the northwest groundswells and can create mixed, messy sets on transitional reef profiles.\n- Incoming Aleutian pulse \u2014 Physics\u2011based arrival: Aleutian 20251015 004 (6 ft @13 s) arrives Fri 10/17 12:25 HST. This pulse is shorter lead\u2011time energy that can reinforce NW surf and push sets higher on exposed NW points; monitor buoys 46089/51001 for confirmation as it approaches.\n\nNotes on generation and confidence: pressure chart shows a large 970 mb low with long, tight W\u2013NW fetch across 40\u201355\u00b0N \u2014 very efficient for long\u2011period NW swell. Satellite imagery corroborates an active high\u2011latitude system and scattered equatorial convection (the latter responsible for spotty S/SE short\u2011period energy). Missing inputs: no altimetry, no operational model output in the digest, and limited nearshore buoy coverage; these increase arrival/size uncertainty by region.\n\nNORTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Primary exposures: Ehukai / Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa, Waimea.\n- Expectations 10/15\u201310/17: Large, long\u2011period NW energy. Open\u2011ocean H1/3 is reported ~14.4 ft @14 s; expect heavy, very powerful surf at exposed reefs. Set faces (H1/10) estimated at ~18\u201319 ft from the matrix \u2014 remember deep\u2011water H1/3 \u2192 local transform and refraction vary by break. Morning light winds can clean up; trades (E\u2013ENE ~8\u201310 kt) are inland\u2011to\u2011onshore in afternoon, increasing texture on NE and north\u2011facing reefs.\n- Hazards: strong rips, heavy shorebreak on shallow reefs (Waimea/Pe\u02bbahi\u2011adjacent zones will be serious). Only very experienced big\u2011wave crews should consider sessions; others stay out.\n- Tides: low late evening (10/15 low ~0.2 ft) exposes reef flats \u2014 holdover sets can wrap onto shallow sections; be conservative. Confidence: medium (0.68); check buoys 51001/51002 and local surf cams for trend confirmation.\n\nSOUTH SHORE (Oahu)\n- Primary exposures: Waikiki, Ala Moana, Makapuu facing south exposures (leeward corners).\n- Expectations 10/15\u201310/17: Southerly swell component present (H1/3 ~8.5 ft @14 s) but island shadowing and refractive losses will blunt peak set faces on many south beaches. Expect rideable but occasionally fat, long\u2011period south sets at the better southern reef / point exposures \u2014 steeper breaks may close out.\n- Local winds: E\u2013ENE trades produce onshore texture and shorter\u2011period chop on east/south\u2011facing beaches; mornings will be cleaner. Tidal phase near low in evenings reduces some south energy on very shallow beaches.\n- Suitability: good for intermediate to advanced shortboarders when south lines are clean; longboarders should expect punchy, unpredictable sets. Confidence: medium; missing nearshore buoy feeds reduce fine\u2011scale accuracy.\n\nOUTLOOK (beyond 10/17)\n- Fri 10/17: Aleutian arrival (6 ft @13 s at ~12:25 HST) should reinforce NW energy \u2014 expect a bump in period coherence and a potential increase in NW set heights on exposed points midday \u2192 afternoon. Monitor buoys 46089 / 51003 for confirmation.\n- Sat\u2013Sun 10/18\u201310/19: Additional modeled/predicted pulses (Aleutian series) are timed to arrive 10/18\u201310/19 (smaller pulses 4\u20135 ft @ ~13\u201314 s). These can extend the elevated NW regime through the weekend with mixed periods (long core + shorter frontal bands) producing choppy, heavy conditions at many breaks.\n- Tropical cue: CPHC outlook: no tropical cyclone formation expected next 7 days \u2014 no tropical augmentation anticipated.\n- Practical: expect a multi\u2011day NW regime with mixed periods and intermittent reinforcement; early mornings will generally be the cleanest window before trades strengthen. Keep a close eye on real\u2011time buoys (51001/51002/51003, 46089/46026), wave model updates, and local cams before committing to large\u2011water sessions.\n\nOperational caveat: chart analysis and satellite confirm a powerful north Pacific source, but the digest lacked altimetry and model runs and nearshore buoy feeds \u2014 that limits precision on exact set heights and timing by break. Use buoy verification and local knowledge to finalize surf plans.\n\nPat \"SwellCaldWell\" Caldwell \u2014 Surf News Network\nForecast confidence: 0.7/1.0.",
  "north_shore": "Short version \u2014 big NW groundswell in the pocket: buoy data show a dominant NW pulse (307\u00b0) at 14.4 ft H1/3 with a long period (14 s), putting the raw faces in the high-teens on the H1/10 estimate (roughly 18\u201319 ft H1/10) during the main window around Oct 15 (window peak listed 2025-10-15 22:56 HST). Secondary N energy (~11 ft H1/3 @ ~13 s) is present as well and will add more northerly energy into exposed points.\n\nWind / tide interplay\n- Observed winds are light ENE (~070\u00b0 at ~9 kt) at PHNL \u2014 that\u2019s a light tradewind component. For most north- to northwest-facing reefs this is a cross-shore to slight sideshore direction: it won\u2019t obliterate shape but it will put texture on open, exposed points and can push lines slightly down-current on the inside. Morning and early-period windows should be the cleanest; watch for any fresh easterly strengthening which will make exposed north-facing points lumpier.\n- Tides are low-ish in the evening (recent low ~0.2 ft around 19:05 HST) with a modest rise overnight \u2014 many North Shore reefs will work best on the mid-to-higher half of the tide with this size swell. Pipeline/Backdoor generally need mid to high for the really hollow barrels; Waimea and Sunset will respond differently (I call that out below). Tide timing and local run-up can materially change how these faces break \u2014 treat local tide readings as part of your lineup decision.\n\nFlagship breaks \u2014 expected faces & conditions\n- Pipeline (Ehukai Reef): expect extreme, hollow, high-energy barrels \u2014 raw faces in the high-teens H1/10 (18\u201320 ft range estimated) during the peak. Very fast, heavy tubes; optimal on a mid-to-high tide. Only highly experienced big-wave crews and jet-supported surfers.\n- Sunset Beach: very powerful, long-lined north-northwest energy; expect heavy, shifting wedges and occasional cavernous sections \u2014 faces in the double-digit Hawaiian range (H1/3 in the teens, H1/10 toward mid-to-high teens). Lots of closeouts and heavy inside rocks on low tide.\n- Waimea Bay: big, punchy pushes on bigger sets \u2014 expect big sets to jack up fast at the channel and towards the rocks; timing with mid-tide favors rideable sets, but hazardous shorebreak and strong currents on the takeoff. Expect closing-out shorelines near low tide.\n- Haleiwa / First Breaks: large north-facing points will see long, powerful lines with current and strong shorewash; expect inconsistent peaks and heavy rips.\n(Notes: exact face heights vary by reef exposure and local bathymetry; H1/3 and H1/10 here are Hawaiian-scale swell estimates based on buoy observations and exposure weighting.)\n\nHazards\n- These measured/estimated heights are at or above common local advisory thresholds for large surf. Expect very dangerous rip currents, strong shorewash and wash-throughs at harbor mouths, significant backwash in confined beaches, and serious impact zones at reef breaks. Not for beginners. Jet-rescue and lifeguard presence will be busy; closures or warnings are possible. (Confidence moderate \u2014 see below.)\n\nWhy I\u2019m saying this (data confidence & uncertainties)\n- Buoy support is solid for the NW pulse (buoy-derived swell with a high exposure weight ~0.82), and there are multiple buoy observations showing long-period NW/N energy \u2014 that raises my confidence that a powerful NW groundswells is in place. The north component shows moderate exposure weighting (~0.50) and is a solid secondary contributor.\n- Caveats: several feeds are missing or limited (no altimetry, no operational model fields in this ingest, no nearshore buoys, and limited upper-air/model fusion). Because of those gaps my timing and exact local refraction/refraction-on-shelf estimates have increased uncertainty. Overall system confidence here is medium (global 0.68); North Shore quality index is ~0.50. In plain terms: I\u2019m confident a big NW pulse is happening; I\u2019m less confident about fine-scale timing for individual reefs and exact peak runup heights without the model/nearshore feeds.\n- Short lead reinforcement: Aleutian-generated energy is predicted to arrive and potentially reinforce the pattern on Oct 17 (6 ft @ 13 s arrival forecast midday Oct 17), so expect sustained large conditions through the period and into the weekend if those arrivals verify (arrival confidence ~75%).\n\nBottom line\n- Expect powerful, high-period NW/N groundswell across the North Shore Oct 15\u201317 with raw faces in the high\u2011teens on exposed reefs (H1/10 estimates \u2248 18\u201319 ft at peak). Best windows will be earlier in the day with lighter winds; conditions will be dangerous \u2014 only experienced big-wave crews and appropriate safety should consider the water. Confidence: moderate (data coverage solid on open-buoy swell observations but limited by missing model/nearshore feeds).",
  "south_shore": "South Shore forecast \u2014 Wed Oct 15 \u2192 Fri Oct 17 (Caldwell-style, data-backed)\n\nOpening assessment \u2014 size, timing, direction\n- Primary energy: south long-period pulse (S, 14 s) that shows up in offshore buoys with H1/3 \u2248 8.5 ft (deep-water). Window/arrival noted late on Oct 15 (buoy window centered ~22:50 HST). Exposure weight for the S component is high (0.99), so this pulse is well aimed at South Shore exposures.\n- Local expectation (reasonable nearshore reduction/refraction): H1/3 at exposed south-facing reefs \u2248 3\u20136 ft (Hawaiian); H1/10 sets to the top end ~4\u20138 ft. Peak energy should be most consistent from late Oct 15 into Oct 16, tapering through Oct 17.\n- Background/complicating energy: strong, long-period NW/N/NW pulses (14 s and 13 s; large buoy readings) and a W component are present offshore. Those are not direct south-swell drivers but will contribute cross-seas and some wrap into certain reef orientations \u2014 expect confused intervals at times.\n\nWrap potential & background southern-hemisphere pulses\n- The S pulse arriving Oct 15 is coherent and well aimed; it\u2019s likely the dominant local driver for the next 24\u201336 hours. Given the long 14 s period and buoy exposure weight, energy will refract efficiently onto broad south-facing reef shelves.\n- NW/W long-period energy is large offshore and will create a secondary cross-sea. On exposed points where bathymetry allows (some west-leaning reef edges and shoreline corners), you\u2019ll see a measurable wrap/angle change \u2014 that produces mixed sets, irregular spacing and occasionally larger odd-ball sets. Expect the cleanest lines early in the day (lighter winds) and the messiest late afternoon when trades peak.\n- Climatology note: fall is winding down for the southern hemi; this pulse looks like a late-season, mid-latitude long-period fetch rather than a tropical swell \u2014 efficient but not a prolonged southern-hemisphere run.\n\nLocal winds & tides (operational implications)\n- Latest METAR: ENE 070\u00b0 at 9 kt. Expect typical trade flow through the period: light-moderate ENE/NE trades (most days 8\u201314 kt). Morning and overnight lulls are likely; afternoons will typically be bumpier as trades strengthen.\n- For South Shore exposures that face due south, NE/ENE trades are cross-onshore to onshore \u2014 they will add texture and reduce clean face quality on most beaches, especially in the afternoon. Mornings should offer the cleanest conditions.\n- Tides: small tidal range. Notable low on Oct 15 evening (\u22480.2 ft around 19:05 HST). That pattern means slightly fuller conditions through morning-midday periods; some inside reefs that prefer a little water will shape better into mid-morning.\n\nTown / reef-by-reef notes (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head)\n- Ala Moana / Magic Island:\n  - Expect increased size and frequent closeouts at the reef at the higher end of the range. The break fills in quickly with tide; onshore ENE trades will make things bumpy in the afternoons.\n  - Best windows: early morning or during tidal rise when lines hold a bit longer. Longboardable when H1/3 is on the lower end (3\u20134 ft Hawaiian), but expect more closeouts as the pulse peaks.\n- Waikiki (Queens, Canoes, Outrigger):\n  - Most consistent and forgiving. Expect longboard-style, open-shoulder rides for much of Oct 16 with sets chest-to-head-high (H1/3 lower end) and occasional bigger runs on the peak sets.\n  - With the long-period S energy, Canoes/Queens will see increased pace and longer rides \u2014 good for longboards and entry-level longboard shortboard hybrids. Mornings are the cleanest; afternoons get bumpier.\n- Diamond Head Reef:\n  - Punchier, more performance-oriented. When the S energy peaks, expect more powerful, faster sections and occasional overhead+ sets on the peaks. Shortboarders and experienced riders will find the best rewards here.\n  - Wind and cross-seas will make takeoffs faster; positioning and timing will be important. Expect more inconsistent sets than Waikiki but higher-performance waves if you can handle the power.\n\nBoard choice, consistency & crowd expectations\n- Longboards: Waikiki/Canoes remain the safest bet for longboarders through the period \u2014 mellow, long lines when the pulse is moderate. If H1/3 trends to the upper end, longboarders should stick inside (Queens/Canoes) or sit out the biggest sets.\n- Shortboards: Diamond Head and the more exposed outlying reefs will reward shortboarders at peak energy, but patience and local knowledge required because of mixed directions and occasional large sets.\n- Consistency & crowding: expect busy lineups at Waikiki and Ala Moana as many surfers favor the protected, predictable peaks. Outer reefs will have fewer people but require higher skill and caution.\n\nRisk & safety notes\n- Long-period sets can be much larger than the prevailing rhythm; expect occasional double-ups and odd-ball sets. Be conservative on paddle-outs and when selecting takeoff spots.\n- Confused cross-seas from NW/W components will create irregular intervals and unpredictable punch. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with local currents and cobbles/reefs, pick a conservative spot.\n\nConfidence statement (data completeness & forecast certainty)\n- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence metric 0.68). Primary reasons: good buoy coverage for offshore swell detection (14/17 buoys successful) and available charts/climatology, but missing feeds reduce certainty \u2014 specifically altimetry, wave models, nearshore buoys and upper-air datasets are unavailable. That reduces precision on exact nearshore amplification, local refraction and short-term timing.\n- Practical takeaway: arrival timing and presence of a notable S 14 s pulse are well supported by buoy observations; nearshore transformation (precise heights at individual reefs, peak hour timing and wind evolution) has increased uncertainty. Expect the broad pattern outlined above, but monitor morning conditions for wind/tide windows and possible higher-than-forecast odd-ball sets.\n\nShort summary (actionable)\n- Late Oct 15 into Oct 16: significant S 14 s pulse arrives \u2014 expect H1/3 ~3\u20136 ft (H1/10 sets larger) across exposed south-facing reefs. Mornings are the cleanest; ENE trades will make afternoons bumpier. Waikiki best for longboards and consistency; Diamond Head for performance shortboarding but more punch and inconsistency. Watch for wrap from NW/W energy producing cross-seas and occasional confused intervals. Medium confidence \u2014 buoy evidence strong, but missing nearshore/model feeds limit fine-scale certainty.",
