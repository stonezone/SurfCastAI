<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Dominant energy is a long‑period NW groundswell (307°) with a measured H1/3 ~14.<strong>4 ft</strong> @ 14 s — large and long‑period; northerly (11.<strong>2 ft</strong> @13 s), westerly and southerly components add mixed periods. Trades are E–ENE ~8–10 kt (PHNL METAR 07009KT), so east faces will be bumpy. A separate Aleutian pulse (<strong>6 ft</strong> @13 s) is predicted to arrive midday Fri 10/17. Forecast confidence: 0.7/1.0; data gaps (no altimetry/models/nearshore buoys) lower precision.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>NW (307°) — Window: observed 10/15 22:56 HST. Source: buoy reports and synoptic analysis; tied to a deep 970 mb extratropical low north of Hawaii (pressure chart). Expect long periods (14 s+) and significant energy — large sets and wide intervals at exposed NW reefs/points. Verify with NDBC/NOAA buoys (recommend checks: 51001, 51002, 51003 and high‑latitude buoys such as 46089 / 46026 for fetch confirmation).</li>
<li>N (350–354°) — Window: observed 10/15 22:56 HST. Secondary N component around 11.<strong>2 ft</strong> H1/3 @13 s; steeper, shorter period than the core NW — will fill in exposed north points and can produce punchy, frequent sets.</li>
<li>S (186°) — Window: observed 10/15 22:50 HST. Long‑period southerly energy shown at H1/3 8.<strong>5 ft</strong> @14 s. Southern energy is real but will be variably shadowed by island orientation and subtropical ridge — expect reduced south set faces at many beaches.</li>
<li>W (268°) — Window: observed 10/15 22:30 HST. Moderate westerly groundswell energy adds cross‑traffic to the northwest groundswells and can create mixed, messy sets on transitional reef profiles.</li>
<li>Incoming Aleutian pulse — Physics‑based arrival: Aleutian 20251015 004 (<strong>6 ft</strong> @13 s) arrives Fri 10/17 12:25 HST. This pulse is shorter lead‑time energy that can reinforce NW surf and push sets higher on exposed NW points; monitor buoys 46089/51001 for confirmation as it approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on generation and confidence: pressure chart shows a large 970 mb low with long, tight W–NW fetch across 40–55°N — very efficient for long‑period NW swell. Satellite imagery corroborates an active high‑latitude system and scattered equatorial convection (the latter responsible for spotty S/SE short‑period energy). Missing inputs: no altimetry, no operational model output in the digest, and limited nearshore buoy coverage; these increase arrival/size uncertainty by region.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE (Oahu)
- Primary exposures: Ehukai / Pipeline, Sunset, Haleiwa, Waimea.
- Expectations 10/15–10/17: Large, long‑period NW energy. Open‑ocean H1/3 is reported ~14.<strong>4 ft</strong> @14 s; expect heavy, very powerful surf at exposed reefs. Set faces (H1/10) estimated at ~<strong>18–19 ft</strong> from the matrix — remember deep‑water H1/3 → local transform and refraction vary by break. Morning light winds can clean up; trades (E–ENE ~8–10 kt) are inland‑to‑onshore in afternoon, increasing texture on NE and north‑facing reefs.
- Hazards: strong rips, heavy shorebreak on shallow reefs (Waimea/Peʻahi‑adjacent zones will be serious). Only very experienced big‑wave crews should consider sessions; others stay out.
- Tides: low late evening (10/15 low ~0.<strong>2 ft</strong>) exposes reef flats — holdover sets can wrap onto shallow sections; be conservative. Confidence: medium (0.68); check buoys 51001/51002 and local surf cams for trend confirmation.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE (Oahu)
- Primary exposures: Waikiki, Ala Moana, Makapuu facing south exposures (leeward corners).
- Expectations 10/15–10/17: Southerly swell component present (H1/3 ~8.<strong>5 ft</strong> @14 s) but island shadowing and refractive losses will blunt peak set faces on many south beaches. Expect rideable but occasionally fat, long‑period south sets at the better southern reef / point exposures — steeper breaks may close out.
- Local winds: E–ENE trades produce onshore texture and shorter‑period chop on east/south‑facing beaches; mornings will be cleaner. Tidal phase near low in evenings reduces some south energy on very shallow beaches.
- Suitability: good for intermediate to advanced shortboarders when south lines are clean; longboarders should expect punchy, unpredictable sets. Confidence: medium; missing nearshore buoy feeds reduce fine‑scale accuracy.</p>
<p>OUTLOOK (beyond 10/17)
- Fri 10/17: Aleutian arrival (<strong>6 ft</strong> @13 s at ~12:25 HST) should reinforce NW energy — expect a bump in period coherence and a potential increase in NW set heights on exposed points midday → afternoon. Monitor buoys 46089 / 51003 for confirmation.
- Sat–Sun 10/18–10/19: Additional modeled/predicted pulses (Aleutian series) are timed to arrive 10/18–10/19 (smaller pulses <strong>4–5 ft</strong> @ ~<strong>13–14 s</strong>). These can extend the elevated NW regime through the weekend with mixed periods (long core + shorter frontal bands) producing choppy, heavy conditions at many breaks.
- Tropical cue: CPHC outlook: no tropical cyclone formation expected next 7 days — no tropical augmentation anticipated.
- Practical: expect a multi‑day NW regime with mixed periods and intermittent reinforcement; early mornings will generally be the cleanest window before trades strengthen. Keep a close eye on real‑time buoys (51001/51002/51003, 46089/46026), wave model updates, and local cams before committing to large‑water sessions.</p>
<p>Operational caveat: chart analysis and satellite confirm a powerful north Pacific source, but the digest lacked altimetry and model runs and nearshore buoy feeds — that limits precision on exact set heights and timing by break. Use buoy verification and local knowledge to finalize surf plans.</p>

            <h2>North Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>Short version — big NW groundswell in the pocket: buoy data show a dominant NW pulse (307°) at 14.<strong>4 ft</strong> H1/3 with a long period (14 s), putting the raw faces in the high-teens on the H1/10 estimate (roughly <strong>18–19 ft</strong> H1/10) during the main window around Oct 15 (window peak listed 2025-10-15 22:56 HST). Secondary N energy (~<strong>11 ft</strong> H1/3 @ ~13 s) is present as well and will add more northerly energy into exposed points.</p>
<p>Wind / tide interplay
- Observed winds are light ENE (~070° at ~9 kt) at PHNL — that’s a light tradewind component. For most north- to northwest-facing reefs this is a cross-shore to slight sideshore direction: it won’t obliterate shape but it will put texture on open, exposed points and can push lines slightly down-current on the inside. Morning and early-period windows should be the cleanest; watch for any fresh easterly strengthening which will make exposed north-facing points lumpier.
- Tides are low-ish in the evening (recent low ~0.<strong>2 ft</strong> around 19:05 HST) with a modest rise overnight — many North Shore reefs will work best on the mid-to-higher half of the tide with this size swell. Pipeline/Backdoor generally need mid to high for the really hollow barrels; Waimea and Sunset will respond differently (I call that out below). Tide timing and local run-up can materially change how these faces break — treat local tide readings as part of your lineup decision.</p>
<p>Flagship breaks — expected faces &amp; conditions
- Pipeline (Ehukai Reef): expect extreme, hollow, high-energy barrels — raw faces in the high-teens H1/10 (<strong>18–20 ft</strong> range estimated) during the peak. Very fast, heavy tubes; optimal on a mid-to-high tide. Only highly experienced big-wave crews and jet-supported surfers.
- Sunset Beach: very powerful, long-lined north-northwest energy; expect heavy, shifting wedges and occasional cavernous sections — faces in the double-digit Hawaiian range (H1/3 in the teens, H1/10 toward mid-to-high teens). Lots of closeouts and heavy inside rocks on low tide.
- Waimea Bay: big, punchy pushes on bigger sets — expect big sets to jack up fast at the channel and towards the rocks; timing with mid-tide favors rideable sets, but hazardous shorebreak and strong currents on the takeoff. Expect closing-out shorelines near low tide.
- Haleiwa / First Breaks: large north-facing points will see long, powerful lines with current and strong shorewash; expect inconsistent peaks and heavy rips.
(Notes: exact face heights vary by reef exposure and local bathymetry; H1/3 and H1/10 here are Hawaiian-scale swell estimates based on buoy observations and exposure weighting.)</p>
<p>Hazards
- These measured/estimated heights are at or above common local advisory thresholds for large surf. Expect very dangerous rip currents, strong shorewash and wash-throughs at harbor mouths, significant backwash in confined beaches, and serious impact zones at reef breaks. Not for beginners. Jet-rescue and lifeguard presence will be busy; closures or warnings are possible. (Confidence moderate — see below.)</p>
<p>Why I’m saying this (data confidence &amp; uncertainties)
- Buoy support is solid for the NW pulse (buoy-derived swell with a high exposure weight ~0.82), and there are multiple buoy observations showing long-period NW/N energy — that raises my confidence that a powerful NW groundswells is in place. The north component shows moderate exposure weighting (~0.50) and is a solid secondary contributor.
- Caveats: several feeds are missing or limited (no altimetry, no operational model fields in this ingest, no nearshore buoys, and limited upper-air/model fusion). Because of those gaps my timing and exact local refraction/refraction-on-shelf estimates have increased uncertainty. Overall system confidence here is medium (global 0.68); North Shore quality index is ~0.50. In plain terms: I’m confident a big NW pulse is happening; I’m less confident about fine-scale timing for individual reefs and exact peak runup heights without the model/nearshore feeds.
- Short lead reinforcement: Aleutian-generated energy is predicted to arrive and potentially reinforce the pattern on Oct 17 (<strong>6 ft</strong> @ 13 s arrival forecast midday Oct 17), so expect sustained large conditions through the period and into the weekend if those arrivals verify (arrival confidence ~75%).</p>
<p>Bottom line
- Expect powerful, high-period NW/N groundswell across the North Shore Oct 15–17 with raw faces in the high‑teens on exposed reefs (H1/10 estimates ≈ <strong>18–19 ft</strong> at peak). Best windows will be earlier in the day with lighter winds; conditions will be dangerous — only experienced big-wave crews and appropriate safety should consider the water. Confidence: moderate (data coverage solid on open-buoy swell observations but limited by missing model/nearshore feeds).</p>

            <h2>South Shore Forecast</h2>
            <p>South Shore forecast — Wed Oct 15 → Fri Oct 17 (Caldwell-style, data-backed)</p>
<p>Opening assessment — size, timing, direction
- Primary energy: south long-period pulse (S, 14 s) that shows up in offshore buoys with H1/3 ≈ 8.<strong>5 ft</strong> (deep-water). Window/arrival noted late on Oct 15 (buoy window centered ~22:50 HST). Exposure weight for the S component is high (0.99), so this pulse is well aimed at South Shore exposures.
- Local expectation (reasonable nearshore reduction/refraction): H1/3 at exposed south-facing reefs ≈ <strong>3–6 ft (Hawaiian)</strong>; H1/10 sets to the top end ~<strong>4–8 ft</strong>. Peak energy should be most consistent from late Oct 15 into Oct 16, tapering through Oct 17.
- Background/complicating energy: strong, long-period NW/N/NW pulses (14 s and 13 s; large buoy readings) and a W component are present offshore. Those are not direct south-swell drivers but will contribute cross-seas and some wrap into certain reef orientations — expect confused intervals at times.</p>
<p>Wrap potential &amp; background southern-hemisphere pulses
- The S pulse arriving Oct 15 is coherent and well aimed; it’s likely the dominant local driver for the next 24–36 hours. Given the long 14 s period and buoy exposure weight, energy will refract efficiently onto broad south-facing reef shelves.
- NW/W long-period energy is large offshore and will create a secondary cross-sea. On exposed points where bathymetry allows (some west-leaning reef edges and shoreline corners), you’ll see a measurable wrap/angle change — that produces mixed sets, irregular spacing and occasionally larger odd-ball sets. Expect the cleanest lines early in the day (lighter winds) and the messiest late afternoon when trades peak.
- Climatology note: fall is winding down for the southern hemi; this pulse looks like a late-season, mid-latitude long-period fetch rather than a tropical swell — efficient but not a prolonged southern-hemisphere run.</p>
<p>Local winds &amp; tides (operational implications)
- Latest METAR: ENE 070° at 9 kt. Expect typical trade flow through the period: light-moderate ENE/NE trades (most days 8–14 kt). Morning and overnight lulls are likely; afternoons will typically be bumpier as trades strengthen.
- For South Shore exposures that face due south, NE/ENE trades are cross-onshore to onshore — they will add texture and reduce clean face quality on most beaches, especially in the afternoon. Mornings should offer the cleanest conditions.
- Tides: small tidal range. Notable low on Oct 15 evening (≈0.<strong>2 ft</strong> around 19:05 HST). That pattern means slightly fuller conditions through morning-midday periods; some inside reefs that prefer a little water will shape better into mid-morning.</p>
<p>Town / reef-by-reef notes (Ala Moana, Waikiki, Diamond Head)
- Ala Moana / Magic Island:
  - Expect increased size and frequent closeouts at the reef at the higher end of the range. The break fills in quickly with tide; onshore ENE trades will make things bumpy in the afternoons.
  - Best windows: early morning or during tidal rise when lines hold a bit longer. Longboardable when H1/3 is on the lower end (<strong>3–4 ft</strong> Hawaiian), but expect more closeouts as the pulse peaks.
- Waikiki (Queens, Canoes, Outrigger):
  - Most consistent and forgiving. Expect longboard-style, open-shoulder rides for much of Oct 16 with sets chest-to-head-high (H1/3 lower end) and occasional bigger runs on the peak sets.
  - With the long-period S energy, Canoes/Queens will see increased pace and longer rides — good for longboards and entry-level longboard shortboard hybrids. Mornings are the cleanest; afternoons get bumpier.
- Diamond Head Reef:
  - Punchier, more performance-oriented. When the S energy peaks, expect more powerful, faster sections and occasional overhead+ sets on the peaks. Shortboarders and experienced riders will find the best rewards here.
  - Wind and cross-seas will make takeoffs faster; positioning and timing will be important. Expect more inconsistent sets than Waikiki but higher-performance waves if you can handle the power.</p>
<p>Board choice, consistency &amp; crowd expectations
- Longboards: Waikiki/Canoes remain the safest bet for longboarders through the period — mellow, long lines when the pulse is moderate. If H1/3 trends to the upper end, longboarders should stick inside (Queens/Canoes) or sit out the biggest sets.
- Shortboards: Diamond Head and the more exposed outlying reefs will reward shortboarders at peak energy, but patience and local knowledge required because of mixed directions and occasional large sets.
- Consistency &amp; crowding: expect busy lineups at Waikiki and Ala Moana as many surfers favor the protected, predictable peaks. Outer reefs will have fewer people but require higher skill and caution.</p>
<p>Risk &amp; safety notes
- Long-period sets can be much larger than the prevailing rhythm; expect occasional double-ups and odd-ball sets. Be conservative on paddle-outs and when selecting takeoff spots.
- Confused cross-seas from NW/W components will create irregular intervals and unpredictable punch. If you’re unfamiliar with local currents and cobbles/reefs, pick a conservative spot.</p>
<p>Confidence statement (data completeness &amp; forecast certainty)
- Overall confidence: medium (global confidence metric 0.68). Primary reasons: good buoy coverage for offshore swell detection (14/17 buoys successful) and available charts/climatology, but missing feeds reduce certainty — specifically altimetry, wave models, nearshore buoys and upper-air datasets are unavailable. That reduces precision on exact nearshore amplification, local refraction and short-term timing.
- Practical takeaway: arrival timing and presence of a notable S 14 s pulse are well supported by buoy observations; nearshore transformation (precise heights at individual reefs, peak hour timing and wind evolution) has increased uncertainty. Expect the broad pattern outlined above, but monitor morning conditions for wind/tide windows and possible higher-than-forecast odd-ball sets.</p>
<p>Short summary (actionable)
- Late Oct 15 into Oct 16: significant S 14 s pulse arrives — expect H1/3 ~<strong>3–6 ft</strong> (H1/10 sets larger) across exposed south-facing reefs. Mornings are the cleanest; ENE trades will make afternoons bumpier. Waikiki best for longboards and consistency; Diamond Head for performance shortboarding but more punch and inconsistency. Watch for wrap from NW/W energy producing cross-seas and occasional confused intervals. Medium confidence — buoy evidence strong, but missing nearshore/model feeds limit fine-scale certainty.</p>

        <h2>Daily Forecast</h2>
        <p>HEADLINE: Massive NW groundswell dominating — North Shore is XXL and expert-only; pick protected spots or sit this one out if you’re not experienced.</p>
<p>NORTH SHORE: Faces N → NW; dominant NW 14s energy (H1/3 14.<strong>4 ft</strong> — H1/10 est ~18.<strong>8 ft</strong>) with supporting N 13s energy (≈<strong>11 ft</strong> H1/3); best window: mid‑morning → late afternoon today while the E/ENE breeze remains light.</p>
<p>SOUTH SHORE: Faces S; secondary S energy ~<strong>8–11 ft</strong> (H1/3 8.<strong>5 ft</strong>, long period) but quartering E/ENE winds will make most south exposures choppy — limited clean opportunities at protected reefs/points.</p>
<p>EAST / WEST: East shore — small to moderate NE wrap, but winds push onshore; West shore — W 14s energy (~<strong>8 ft</strong> H1/3) could light up protected west points; check local protection from the east breeze.</p>
<p>WINDS: METAR PHNL shows 070° at ~9 kt (E/ENE light breeze) — sideshore to slightly offshore for many north‑facing breaks (helps clean faces), quartering onshore for south exposures (junkier). Expect conditions to deteriorate if trades strengthen later; monitor cams for diurnal pickup.</p>
<h3>Tides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low today 19:05 HST — 0.<strong>20 ft</strong> (shallow; reef hazards and strong currents near low).</li>
<li>Latest obs 23:12 HST: 1.<strong>57 ft</strong> (tide rising toward next high).
Plan for mid‑tide sessions to reduce exposed reef/shoaling risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACTION ITEM: If you’re not a committed big‑wave rider with a support team, do not go North Shore — pick a protected east/west spot or stay home; if you’re experienced, aim for mid‑morning → late afternoon with safety teams and local knowledge. Confidence: medium (0.68) — some nearshore/model feeds missing; recheck spot cams and local forecasts before heading out.</p>
