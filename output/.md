## Main Forecast

I’m ready to improve it, but I don’t have the actual forecast text yet. Please paste the forecast you’d like me to review and rewrite, and I’ll deliver an optimized version.

What I’ll deliver after you paste it:
- A technically accurate, clearer version with consistent swell heights, periods, and directions
- Full coverage for all relevant shores and time windows (morning, midday, late)
- Internal consistency (same units, time zone, direction conventions, rounding)
- Specific timing, locations, and condition notes (best breaks, wind windows, tides)
- Preservation of your original voice and style, with improved clarity and detail

If it helps, you can share any of the following to tailor the output:
- Target area(s) and breaks to emphasize (e.g., north/northwest shores, exposed reef, point breaks)
- Known local caveats (shoreline shifts, wind fetch quirks, seasonal patterns)
- Forecast timeframe (e.g., 24–48 hours, 5 days) and update cadence
- Model/run used (e.g., NOAA, GFS/ECMWF blend) and preferred units (ft/m, knots, etc.)

What I’ll watch for and fix in every forecast:
- Technical accuracy: consistent swell height (ft/m), period (s), and direction (bearing or labeled cardinal direction)
- Clarity: translate model outputs into actionable guidance (e.g., “best early morning onshore winds fade by late morning”)
- Completeness: cover all major shores, wind/sea states, tides, and advisory notes
- Consistency: uniform units, abbreviations, and tone throughout
- Specificity: precise times, locations, and condition flags (e.g., knee-to-chest at X break, NW wind 10–15 mph)

Paste the forecast now and I’ll produce an optimized version right away.

## Daily Forecast

I can do that, but I don’t have live data here. Do you want me to:

A) Provide a best-guess Oahu daily forecast for 2025-10-02 based on typical October patterns (clearly labeled as estimated), or
B) Give you a ready-to-fill report template and you supply current wind, tide, and buoy data (I’ll summarize once you share them)?
